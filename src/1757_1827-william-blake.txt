A hollow groan ran thro' the dreary vaults. She shriek'd aloud, and sunk upon the steps, On the cold stone her pale cheeks. Sickly smells Of death issue as from a sepulchre, And all is silent but the sighing vaults.  Chill Death withdraws his hand, and she revives; Amaz'd, she finds herself upon her feet, And, like a ghost, thro' narrow passages Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands.  Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones And grinning skulls, and corruptible death Wrapp'd in his shroud; and now fancies she hears Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding.  At length, no fancy but reality Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet Of one that fled, approaches--Ellen stood Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear.  The wretch approaches, crying: `The deed is done; Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send; It is my life--send it to Elenor:-- He's dead, and howling after me for blood!  `Take this,' he cried; and thrust into her arms A wet napkin, wrapp'd about; then rush'd Past, howling: she receiv'd into her arms Pale death, and follow'd on the wings of fear.  They pass'd swift thro' the outer gate; the wretch, Howling, leap'd o'er the wall into the moat, Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen pass'd the bridge, And heard a gloomy voice cry `Is it done?'  As the deer wounded, Ellen flew over The pathless plain; as the arrows that fly By night, destruction flies, and strikes in darkness. She fled from fear, till at her house arriv'd.  Her maids await her; on her bed she falls, That bed of joy, where erst her lord hath press'd: `Ah, woman's fear!' she cried; `ah, curs\u00e8d duke! Ah, my dear lord! ah, wretched Elenor!  `My lord was like a flower upon the brows Of lusty May! Ah, life as frail as flower! O ghastly death! withdraw thy cruel hand, Seek'st thou that flow'r to deck thy horrid temples?  `My lord was like a star in highest heav'n Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness; My lord was like the opening eyes of day When western winds creep softly o'er the flowers;  `But he is darken'd; like the summer's noon Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down; The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves. O Elenor, weak woman, fill'd with woe!'  Thus having spoke, she rais\u00e8d up her head, And saw the bloody napkin by her side, Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold More terrifi\u00e8d, saw it unfold itself.  Her eyes were fix'd; the bloody cloth unfolds, Disclosing to her sight the murder'd head Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted With gory blood; it groan'd, and thus it spake:  `O Elenor, I am thy husband's head, Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower, Was 'reft of life by the accurs\u00e8d duke! A hir\u00e8d villain turn'd my sleep to death!  `O Elenor, beware the curs\u00e8d duke; O give not him thy hand, now I am dead; He seeks thy love; who, coward, in the night, Hir\u00e8d a villain to bereave my life.'  She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffen'd to stone; She took the gory head up in her arms; She kiss'd the pale lips; she had no tears to shed; She hugg'd it to her breast, and groan'd her last. \r\n                         \n", "The Grey Monk": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        1     'I die, I die!' the Mother said,  2     'My children die for lack of bread. 3     What more has the merciless Tyrant said?' 4     The Monk sat down on the stony bed.  5     The blood red ran from the Grey Monk's side, 6     His hands and feet were wounded wide, 7     His body bent, his arms and knees 8     Like to the roots of ancient trees.  9     His eye was dry; no tear could flow: 10   A hollow groan first spoke his woe. 11   He trembled and shudder'd upon the bed; 12   At length with a feeble cry he said:  13   'When God commanded this hand to write 14   In the studious hours of deep midnight, 15   He told me the writing I wrote should prove 16   The bane of all that on Earth I lov'd.  17   My Brother starv'd between two walls, 18   His Children's cry my soul appalls; 19   I mock'd at the rack and griding chain, 20   My bent body mocks their torturing pain.  21   Thy father drew his sword in the North, 22   With his thousands strong he marched forth; 23   Thy Brother has arm'd himself in steel 24   To avenge the wrongs thy Children feel.  25   But vain the Sword and vain the Bow, 26   They never can work War's overthrow. 27   The Hermit's prayer and the Widow's tear 28   Alone can free the World from fear.  29   For a Tear is an intellectual thing, 30   And a Sigh is the sword of an Angel King, 31   And the bitter groan of the Martyr's woe 32   Is an arrow from the Almighty's bow.  33   The hand of Vengeance found the bed 34   To which the Purple Tyrant fled; 35   The iron hand crush'd the Tyrant's head 36   And became a Tyrant in his stead.' \r\n                         \n", "The Song Of Los": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        AFRICA   I will sing you a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet:  He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity.  In heart-formed Africa.  Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd!  And thus the Song began   Adam stood in the garden of Eden:  And Noah on the mountains of Ararat;  They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations  By the hands of the children of Los.   Adam shudderd! Noah faded! black grew the sunny African  When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East:  (Night spoke to the Cloud!  Lo these Human form'd spirits in smiling hipocrisy. War  Against one another; so let them War on; slaves to the eternal Elements)  Noah shrunk, beneath the waters;  Abram fled in fires from Chaldea;  Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion:   To Trismegistus. Palamabron gave an abstract Law:  To Pythagoras Socrates &amp; Plato.   Times rolled on o'er all the sons of Har, time after time  Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain'd down with the Chain of Jealousy  Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah &amp; Jerusalem  And Jesus heard her voice (a man of sorrows) he recievd  A Gospel from wretched Theotormon.   The human race began to wither, for the healthy built  Secluded places, fearing the joys of Love  And the disease'd only propagated:  So Antamon call'd up Leutha from her valleys of delight:  And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave.  But in the North, to Odin, Sotha gave a Code of War,  Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy.   These were the Churches: Hospitals: Castles: Palaces:  Like nets &amp; gins &amp; traps to catch the joys of Eternity  And all the rest a desart;  Till like a dream Eternity was obliterated &amp; erased.   Since that dread day when Har and Heva fled.  Because their brethren &amp; sisters liv'd in War &amp; Lust;  And as they fled they shrunk  Into two narrow doleful forms:  Creeping in reptile flesh upon  The bosom of the ground:  And all the vast of Nature shrunk  Before their shrunken eyes.   Thus the terrible race of Los &amp; Enitharmon gave  Laws &amp; Religions to the sons of Har binding them more  And more to Earth: closing and restraining:  Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete  Urizen wept &amp; gave it into the hands of Newton &amp; Locke   Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau &amp; Voltaire:  And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods  Of Asia; &amp; on the deserts of Africa round the Fallen Angels  The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent    ASIA   The Kings of Asia heard  The howl rise up from Europe!  And each ran out from his Web;  From his ancient woven Den;  For the darkness of Asia was startled  At the thick-flaming, thought-creating fires of Orc.   And the Kings of Asia stood  And cried in bitterness of soul.   Shall not the King call for Famine from the heath?  Nor the Priest, for Pestilence from the fen?  To restrain! to dismay! to thin!  The inhabitants of mountain and plain;  In the day, of full-feeding prosperity;  And the night of delicious songs.   Shall not the Councellor throw his curb  Of Poverty on the laborious?  To fix the price of labour;  To invent allegoric riches:   And the privy admonishers of men  Call for fires in the City  For heaps of smoking ruins,  In the night of prosperity &amp; wantonness   To turn man from his path,  To restrain the child from the womb,   To cut off the bread from the city,  That the remnant may learn to obey.  That the pride of the heart may fail;  That the lust of the eyes may be quench'd:  That the delicate ear in its infancy   May be dull'd; and the nostrils clos'd up;  To teach mortal worms the path  That leads from the gates of the Grave.   Urizen heard them cry!  And his shudd'ring waving wings  Went enormous above the red flames  Drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens  Of Europe as he went:  And his Books of brass iron &amp; gold  Melted over the land as he flew,   Heavy-waving, howling, weeping.   And he stood over Judea:  And stay'd in his ancient place:  And stretch'd his clouds over Jerusalem;   For Adam, a mouldering skeleton  Lay bleach'd on the garden of Eden;  And Noah as white as snow  On the mountains of Ararat.   Then the thunders of Urizen bellow'd aloud  From his woven darkness above.   Orc raging in European darkness  Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps  Like a serpent of fiery flame!  The sullen Earth  Shrunk!   Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones  Join: shaking convuls'd the shivring clay breathes  And all flesh naked stands: Fathers and Friends;  Mothers &amp; Infants; Kings &amp; Warriors:   The Grave shrieks with delight, &amp; shakes  Her hollow womb, &amp; clasps the solid stem:  Her bosom swells with wild desire:  And milk &amp; blood &amp; glandous wine. \r\n                         \n", "The New Jerusalem": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        And did those feet in ancient time  \tWalk upon England's mountains green?  \tAnd was the holy Lamb of God  \tOn England's pleasant pastures seen?    \tAnd did the Countenance Divine  \tShine forth upon our clouded hills?  \tAnd was Jerusalem builded here  \tAmong these dark Satanic Mills?    \tBring me my bow of burning gold!  \tBring me my arrows of desire!  \tBring me my spear!

O Truth! that shinest with propitious beams, turning our earthly night to heavenly day, from presence of the Almighty Father, thou visitest our darkling world with blessed feet, bringing good news of Sin and Death destroyed! O whiterobed Angel, guide my timorous hand to write as on a lofty rock with iron pen the words of truth, that all who pass may read. -- Now Night, noontide of damned spirits, over the silent earth spreads her pavilion, while in dark council sat Philista's lords; and, where strength failed, black thoughts in ambush lay. Their helmed youth and aged warriors in dust together lie, and Desolation spreads his wings over the land of Palestine: from side to side the land groans, her prowess lost, and seeks to hide her bruised head under the mists of night, breeding dark plots. For Dalila's fair arts have long been tried in vain; in vain she wept in many a treacherous tear. `Go on, fair traitress; do thy guileful work; ere once again the changing moon her circuit hath performed, thou shalt overcome, and conquer him by force unconquerable, and wrest his secret from him. Call thine alluring arts and honest-seeming brow, the holy kiss of love, and the transparent tear; put on fair linen that with the lily vies, purple and silver; neglect thy hair, to seem more lovely in thy loose attire; put on thy country's pride, deceit, and eyes of love decked in mild sorrow; and sell thy lord for gold.' For now, upon her sumptuous couch reclined in gorgeous pride, she still entreats, and still she grasps his vigorous knees with her fair arms. `Thou lov'st me not! thou'rt war, thou art not love! O foolish Dalila! O weak woman! it is death clothed in flesh thou lovest, and thou hast been encircled in his arms! Alas, my lord, what am I calling thee? Thou art my God! To thee I pour my tears for sacrifice morning and evening. My days are covered with sorrow, shut up, darkened! By night I am deceived! Who says that thou wast born of mortal kind? Destruction was thy father, a lioness suckled thee, thy young hands tore human limbs, and gorged human flesh. Come hither, Death; art thou not Samson's servant? 'Tis Dalila that calls, thy master's wife; no, stay, and let thy master do the deed: one blow of that strong arm would ease my pain; then should I lay at quiet and have rest. Pity forsook thee at thy birth! O Dagon furious, and all ye gods of Palestine, withdraw your hand! I am but a weak woman. Alas, I am wedded to your enemy! I will go mad, and tear my crisped hair; 1000 I'll run about, and pierce the ears o' th' gods! O Samson, hold me not; thou lovest me not! Look not upon me with those deathful eyes! Thou wouldst my death, and death approaches fast.' Thus, in false tears, she bath'd his feet, and thus she day by day oppressed his soul: he seemed a mountain; his brow among the clouds; she seemed a silver stream, his feet embracing. Dark thoughts rolled to and fro in his mind, like thunder clouds troubling the sky; his visage was troubled; his soul was distressed. `Though I should tell her all my heart, what can I fear? Though I should tell this secret of my birth, the utmost may be warded off as well when told as now.' She saw him moved, and thus resumes her wiles. `Samson, I'm thine; do with me what thou wilt: my friends are enemies; my life is death; I am a traitor to my nation, and despised; my joy is given into the hands of him who hates me, using deceit to the wife of his bosom. Thrice hast thou mocked me and grieved my soul. Didst thou not tell me with green withs to bind thy nervous arms; and, after that, when I had found thy falsehood, with new ropes to bind thee fast? I knew thou didst but mock me. Alas, when in thy sleep I bound thee with them to try thy truth, I cried, \"The Philistines be upon thee, Samson!\" Then did suspicion wake thee; how didst thou rend the feeble ties! Thou fearest nought, what shouldst thou fear? Thy power is more than mortal, none can hurt thee; thy bones are brass, thy sinews are iron. Ten thousand spears are like the summer grass; an army of mighty men are as flocks in the valleys; what canst thou fear? I drink my tears like water; I live upon sorrow! O worse than wolves and tigers, what canst thou give when such a trifle is denied me? But O! at last thou mockest me, to shame my over-fond inquiry. Thou toldest me to weave thee to the beam by thy strong hair; I did even that to try thy truth; but, when I cried \"The Philistines be upon thee!\" then didst thou leave me to bewail that Samson loved me not.' He sat, and inward griev'd; he saw and lov'd the beauteous suppliant, nor could conceal aught that might appease her; then, leaning on her bosom, thus he spoke: `Hear, O Dalila! doubt no more of Samson's love; for that fair breast was made the ivory palace of my inmost heart, where it shall lie at rest: for sorrow is the lot of all of woman born: for care was I brought forth, and labour is my lot: nor matchless might, nor wisdom, nor every gift enjoyed, can from the heart of man hide sorrow. Twice was my birth foretold from heaven, and twice a sacred vow enjoined me that I should drink no wine, nor eat of any unclean thing; for holy unto Israel's God I am, a Nazarite even from my mother's womb. Twice was it told, that it might not be broken. \"Grant me a son, kind Heaven,\" Manoa cried; but Heaven refused. Childless he mourned, but thought his God knew best. In solitude, though not obscure, in Israel he lived, till venerable age came on: his flocks increased, and plenty crowned his board, beloved, revered of man. But God hath other joys in store. Is burdened Israel his grief? The son of his old age shall set it free! The venerable sweetener of his life receives the promise first from Heaven. She saw the maidens play, and blessed their innocent mirth; she blessed each new-joined pair; but from her the long-wished deliverer shall spring. Pensive, alone she sat within the house, when busy day was fading, and calm evening, time for contemplation, rose from the forsaken east, and drew the curtains of heaven: pensive she sat, and thought on Israel's grief, and silent prayed to Israel's God; when lo! an angel from the fields of light entered the house. His form was manhood in the prime, and from his spacious brow shot terrors through the evening shade. But mild he hailed her, \"Hail, highly favoured!\" said he; \"for lo! thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and Israel's strength shall be upon his shoulders, and he shall be called Israel's Deliverer. Now, therefore, drink no wine, and eat not any unclean thing, for he shall be a Nazarite to God.\" Then, as a nei 727 ghbour, when his evening tale is told, departs, his blessing leaving, so seemed he to depart: she wondered with exceeding joy, nor knew he was an angel. Manoa left his fields to sit in the house, and take his evening's rest from labour -- the sweetest time that God has allotted mortal man. He sat, and heard with joy, and praised God, who Israel still doth keep. The time rolled on, and Israel groaned oppressed. The sword was bright, while the ploughshare rusted, till hope grew feeble, and was ready to give place to doubting. Then prayed Manoa: \"O Lord, thy flock is scattered on the hills! The wolf teareth them, Oppression stretches his rod over our land, our country is ploughed with swords, and reaped in blood. The echoes of slaughter reach from hill to hill. Instead of peaceful pipe the shepherd bears a sword, the ox-goad is turned into a spear. O when shall our Deliverer come? The Philistine riots on our flocks, our vintage is gathered by bands of enemies. Stretch forth thy hand, and save!\" Thus prayed Manoa. The aged woman walked into the field, and lo! again the angel came, clad as a traveller fresh risen on his journey. She ran and called her husband, who came and talked with him. \"O man of God,\" said he, \"thou comest from far! Let us detain thee while I make ready a kid, that thou mayest sit and eat, and tell us of thy name and warfare; that, when thy sayings come to pass, we may honour thee.\" The Angel answered, \"My name is Wonderful; inquire not after it, seeing it is a secret; but, if thou wilt, offer an offering unto the Lord.\"' \r\n                         \n", "The Little Vagabond": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Dear mother, dear mother, the church is cold,    But the ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm;    Besides I can tell where I am used well,    Such usage in Heaven will never do well.
