This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,      To love that well which thou must leave ere long. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet Lxxxv": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                             My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,      While comments of your praise, richly compiled,      Reserve their character with golden quill      And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.      I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,      And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'      To every hymn that able spirit affords      In polish'd form of well-refined pen.      Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'      And to the most of praise add something more;      But that is in my thought, whose love to you,      Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.      Then others for the breath of words respect,      Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect. \r\n                         \n", "The Rival Poet Sonnets (78 - 86)": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        LXXVIII  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse, And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse. Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, Have added feathers to the learned's wing And given grace a double majesty. Yet be most proud of that which I compile, Whose influence is thine, and born of thee: In others' works thou dost but mend the style, And arts with thy sweet graces graced be; But thou art all my art, and dost advance As high as learning my rude ignorance.   LXXIX  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid, My verse alone had all thy gentle grace; But now my gracious numbers are decay'd, And my sick Muse doth give an other place. I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen; Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of, and pays it thee again. He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give, And found it in thy cheek: he can afford No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live. Then thank him not for that which he doth say, Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.   LXXX  O! how I faint when I of you do write, Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, And in the praise thereof spends all his might, To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. But since your worth, wide as the ocean is, The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, My saucy bark, inferior far to his, On your broad main doth wilfully appear. Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride; Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat, He of tall building, and of goodly pride: Then if he thrive and I be cast away, The worst was this, my love was my decay.   LXXXI  Or I shall live your epitaph to make, Or you survive when I in earth am rotten, From hence your memory death cannot take, Although in me each part will be forgotten. Your name from hence immortal life shall have, Though I, once gone, to all the world must die: The earth can yield me but a common grave, When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie. Your monument shall be my gentle verse, Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read; And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse, When all the breathers of this world are dead; You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen, Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.   LXXXII  I grant thou wert not married to my Muse, And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject, blessing every book. Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, Finding thy worth a limit past my praise; And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd, What strained touches rhetoric can lend, Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend; And their gross painting might be better usd Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abusd.   LXXXIII  I never saw that you did painting need, And therefore to your fair no painting set; I found, or thought I found, you did exceed The barren tender of a poet's debt: And therefore have I slept in your report, That you yourself, being extant, well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short, Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. This silence for my sin you did impute, Which shall be most my glory being dumb; For I impair not beauty being mute, When others would give life, and bring a tomb. There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise.   LXXXIV  Who is it that says most, which can say more, Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you, In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew? Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory; But he that writes of you, if he can tell That you are you, so dignifies his story. Let him but copy what in you is writ, Not making worse what nature made so clear, And such a counterpart shall fame his wit, Making his style admired every where. You to your beauteous blessings add a curse, Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.   LXXXV  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still, While comments of your praise richly compiled, Reserve thy character with golden quill, And precious phrase by all the Muses filed. I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words, And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen' To every hymn that able spirit affords, In polished form of well-refined pen. Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,' And to the most of praise add something more; But that is in my thought, whose love to you, Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before. Then others, for the breath of words respect, Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.   LXXXVI  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, Bound for the prize of all too precious you, That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? No, neither he, nor his compeers by night Giving him aid, my verse astonished. He, nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence, As victors of my silence cannot boast; I was not sick of any fear from thence: But when your countenance filled up his line, Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet Xxiv": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                             Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd      Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;      My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,      And perspective it is the painter's art.      For through the painter must you see his skill,      To find where your true image pictured lies;      Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,      That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.      Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:      Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me      Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun      Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;      Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;      They draw but what they see, know not the heart. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet Xli": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                             Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,      When I am sometime absent from thy heart,      Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,      For still temptation follows where thou art.      Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,      Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;      And when a woman woos, what woman's son      Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?      Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,      And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,      Who lead thee in their riot even there      Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,      Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,      Thine, by thy beauty being false to me. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet Xliv": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                             If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,      Injurious distance should not stop my way;      For then despite of space I would be brought,      From limits far remote where thou dost stay.      No matter then although my foot did stand      Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;      For nimble thought can jump both sea and land      As soon as think the place where he would be.      But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,      To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,      But that so much of earth and water wrought      I must attend time's leisure with my moan,      Receiving nought by elements so slow      But heavy tears, badges of either's woe. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet Lxxxvi": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                             Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,      Bound for the prize of all too precious you,      That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,      Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
