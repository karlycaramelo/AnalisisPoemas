{"Piere Vidal Old": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        When I but think upon the great dead days And turn my mind upon that splendid madness, Lo! I do curse my strength And blame the sun his gladness; For that the one is dead And the red sun mocks my sadness.  Behold me, Vidal, that was fool of fools! Swift as the king wolf was I and as strong When tall stags fled me through the alder brakes, And every jongleur knew me in his song, And the hounds fled and the deer fled And none fled over long.  Even the grey pack knew me and knew fear. God! how the swiftest hind's blood spurted hot Over the sharpened teeth and purpling lips! Hot was that hind's blood yet it scorched me not As did first scorn, then lips of the Penautier! Aye ye are fools, if ye think time can blot  From Piere Vidal\u2019s remembrance that blue night. God! but the purple of the sky was deep! Clear, deep, translucent, so the stars me seemed Set deep in crystal; and because my sleep Rare visitor came not, the Saints I guerdon For that restlessness Piere set to keep  One more fool's vigil with the hollyhocks. Swift came the Loba, as a branch that's caught, Torn, green and silent in the swollen Rhone, Green was her mantle, close, and wrought Of some thin silk stuff that's scarce stuff at all, But like a mist wherethrough her white form fought,  And conquered! Ah God! conquered! Silent my mate came as the night was still. Speech? Words? Faugh! Who talks of words and love?! Hot is such love and silent, Silent as fate is, and as strong until It faints in taking and in giving all.  Stark, keen, triumphant, till it plays at death. God! she was white then, splendid as some tomb High wrought of marble, and the panting breath Ceased utterly. Well, then I waited, drew, Half-sheathed, then naked from its saffron sheath Drew full this dagger that doth tremble here.  Just then she woke and mocked the less keen blade. Ah God, the Loba! and my only mate! Was there such flesh made ever and unmade! God curse the years that turn such women grey! Behold here Vidal, that was hunted, flayed, Shamed and yet bowed not and that won at last.  And yet I curse the sun for his red gladness, I that have known strath, garth, brake, dale, And every run-away of the wood through that great madness, Behold me shrivelled as an old oak's trunk And made men's mock'ry in my rotten sadness!  No man hath heard the glory of my days: No man hath dared and won his dare as I: One night, one body and one welding flame! What do ye own, ye niggards! that can buy Such glory of the earth? Or who will win Such battle-guerdon with his 'prowesse high' ?  O age gone lax! O stunted followers, That mask at passions and desire desires, Behold me shrivelled, and your mock of mocks; And yet I mock you by the mighty fires That burnt me to this ash.  Ah! Cabaret! Ah Cabaret, thy hills again!  Take your hands off me! . . . [Sniffing the air.

Petals are on the gone waters and on the going, And on the back-swirling eddies, But to-day's men are not the men of the old days, Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail.  The sea's colour moves at the dawn And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne, And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo, And clings to the walls and the gate-top.

They ride upon dragon-like horses, Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow metal, And the streets make way for their passage. Haughty their passing, Haughty their steps as they go in to great banquets, To high halls and curious food, To the perfumed air and girls dancing, To clear flutes and clear singing; To the dance of the seventy couples; To the mad chase through the gardens.

The constitution of our land, O Socrates, Was made to incubate such mediocrities, These and a state in books that's grown perennial And antedates the Philadelphia centennial. Still I'd respect you more if you could bury Mabie, and Lyman Abbot and George Woodberry, For minds so wholly founded upon quotations Are not the best of pulse for infant nations.

Here Radway grew, the fruit of pantosocracy, The very fairest flower of their gynocracy. Radway ? My hero, for it will be more inspiring If I set forth a bawdy plot like Byron Than if I treat the nation as a whole. Radway grew up. These forces shaped his soul; These, and yet God, and Dr. Parkhurst's god, the N.Y. Journal (Which pays him more per week than The Supernal). These and another godlet of that day, your day (You feed a hen on grease, perhaps she'll lay The sterile egg that is still eatable: 'Prolific Noyes' with output undefeatable). From these he (Radway) learnt, from provosts and from editors unyielding And innocent of Stendhal, Flaubert, Maupassant and Fielding. They set their mind (it's still in that condition) May we repeat; the Centennial Exposition At Philadelphia, 1876? What it knew then, it knows, and there it sticks. And yet another, a 'charming man', \u2018sweet nature,' but was Gilder, De mortuis verum, truly the master builder?  From these he learnt. Poe, Whitman, Whistler, men, their recognition Was got abroad, what better luck do you wish 'em, When writing well has not yet been forgiven In Boston, to Henry James, the greatest whom we've seen living. And timorous love of the innocuous Brought from Gt. Britain and dumped down a'top of us, Till you may take your choice: to feel the edge of satire or Read Bennett or some other flaccid flatterer. Despite it all, despite your Red Bloods, febrile concupiscence Whose blubbering yowls you take for passion's essence; Despite it all, your compound predilection For ignorance, its growth and its protection (Vide the tariff), I will hang simple facts Upon a tale, to combat other tracts, 'Message to Garcia,' Mosher's propagandas That are the nation's botts, collicks and glanders. Or from the feats of Sumner cull it? Think, Could Freud or Jung'unfathom such a sink?  My hero, Radway, I have named, in truth, Some forces among those which 'formed' his youth: These heavy weights, these dodgers and these preachers, Crusaders, lecturers and secret lechers, Who wrought about his 'soul' their stale infection. These are the high-brows, and to this collection The social itch, the almost, all but, not quite, fascinating, Piquante, delicious, luscious, captivating: Puffed satin, and silk stockings, where the knee Clings to the skirt in strict (vide: 'Vogue') propriety. Three thousand chorus girls and all unkissed, state sans song, sans home-grown wine, sans realist! 'Tell me not in mournful wish-wash Life's a sort of sugared dish-wash!' Radway had read the various evening papers And yearned to imitate the Waldorf capers As held before him in that unsullied mirror The daily press, and monthlies nine cents dearer. They held the very marrow of the ideals That fed his spirit; were his mental meals. Also, he'd read of Christian virtues in That canting rag called Everybody's Magazine, And heard a clergy that tries on more wheezes Than e'er were heard of by Our Lord Ch . . . . J So he 'faced life' with rather mixed intentions, He had attended country Christian Endeavour Conventions, Where one gets more chances Than Spanish ladies had in old romances. (Let him rebuke who ne'er has known the pure Platonic grapple, Or hugged two girls at once behind a chapel.) Such practices diluted rural boredom Though some approved of them, and some deplored 'em. Such was he when he got his mother's letter And would not think a thing that could upset her. . . . Yet saw an ad.' To-night, THE HUDSON SAIL, With forty queens, and music to regale The select company: beauties you all would know By name, if named.' So it was phrased, or rather somewhat so I have mislaid the \u2018ad.', but note the touch, Note, reader, note the sentimental touch: His mother's birthday gift. (How pitiful That only sentimental stuff will sell!)  Yet Radway went. A circumspectious prig! And then that woman like a guinea-pig Accosted, that's the word, accosted him, Thereon the amorous calor slightly frosted him. (I burn, I freeze, I sweat, said the fair Greek, I speak in contradictions, so to speak.)  I've told his training, he was never bashful, And his pockets by ma's aid, that night with cash full, The invitation had no need of fine aesthetic, Nor did disgust prove such a strong emetic That we, with Masefield's vein, in the next sentence Record \u2018Odd's blood! Ouch! Ouch!' a prayer, his swift repentance. No, no, they danced. The music grew much louder As he inhaled the 'still fumes of rice-powder. Then there came other nights, came slow but certain And were such nights that we should 'draw the curtain' In writing fiction on uncertain chances Of publication; 'Circumstances,' As the editor of The Century says in print, 'Compel a certain silence and restraint.' Still we will bring our 'fiction as near to fact' as The Sunday school brings virtues into practice.  Soon our hero could manage once a week, Not that his pay had risen, and no leak Was found in his employer's cash. He learned the lay of cheaper places, And then Radway began to go the paces: A rosy path, a sort of vernal ingress, And Truth should here be careful of her thin dress Though males of seventy, who fear truths naked harm us, Must think Truth looks as they do in wool pyjamas. (My country, I've said your morals and your thoughts are stale ones, But surely the worst of your old-women are the male ones.)  Why paint these days? An insurance inspector For fires and odd risks, could in this sector Furnish more data for a compilation Than I can from this distant land and station, Unless perhaps I should have recourse to One of those firm-faced inspecting women, who Find pretty Irish girls in Chinese laundries, Up stairs, the third floor up, and have such quandaries As to how and why and whereby they got in And for what earthly reason they remain. . . . Alas, eheu, one question that sorely vexes The serious social folk is \u2018just what sex is'. Though it will, of course, pass off with social science In which their mentors place such wide reliance . . De Gourmont says that fifty grunts are all that will be prized. Of langauge, by men wholly socialized, With signs as many, that shall represent 'em When thoroughly socialized printers want to print 'em. \u2018As free of mobs as kings'? I'd have men free of that invidious, Lurking, serpentine, amphibious and insidious Power that compels 'em To be so much alike that every dog that smells 'em, Thinks one identity is Smeared o'er the lot in equal quantities. Still we look toward the day when man, with unction, Will long only to be a social function, And even Zeus' wild lightning fear to strike Lest it should fail to treat all men alike. And I can hear an old man saying: \u2018Oh, the rub!\u2019 I see them sitting in the Harvard Club, 'And rate 'em up at just so much per head, 'Till I have viewed straw hats and their habitual clothing 'All the same style, same cut, with perfect loathing.'  So Radway walked, quite like the other men, Out into the crepuscular half-light, now and then; Saw what the city offered, cast an eye Upon Manhattan's gorgeous panoply, The flood of limbs upon Eighth Avenue To beat Prague, Budapesth, Vienna or Moscow, Such animal invigorating carriage As nothing can restrain or much disparage. . . . Still he was not given up to brute enjoyment, An anxious sentiment was his employment, For memory of the first warm night still cast a haze o'er The mind of Radway, whene'er he found a pair of purple stays or Some other quaint reminder of the occasion That first made him believe in immoral suasion. A temperate man, a thin potationist, each day A silent hunter off the Great White Way, He read The Century and thought it nice To be not too well known in haunts of vice The prominent haunts, where one might recognize him, And in his daily walks duly capsize him. Thus he eschewed the bright red-walled cafes and Was never one of whom one speaks as \u2018brazen'd'.  Some men will live as prudes in their own village And make the tour abroad for their wild tillage I knew a tourist agent, one whose art is To run such tours. He calls 'em. . . . house parties. But Radway was a patriot whose venality Was purer in its love of one locality, A home-industrious worker to perfection, A sensational jobber for protection, Especially on books, lest knowledge break in Upon the national brains and set 'em achin'. 'Tis an anomaly in our large land of freedom, You can not get cheap books, even if you need 'em.) Radway was ignorant as an editor, And, heavenly, holy gods! I can't say more, Though I know one, a very base detractor, Who has the phrase \u2018As ignorant as an actor,' But turn to Radway: the first night on the river, Running so close to \u2018hell\u2019 it sends a shiver Down Rodyheaver's prophylactic spine, Let me return to this bold theme of mine, Of Radway. O clap hand ye moralists! And meditate upon the Lord's conquests. When last I met him, he was a pillar in An organization for the suppression of sin. . . . Not that he'd changed his tastes, nor yet his habits, (Such changes don't occur in men, or rabbits). Not that he was a saint, nor was top-loftical In spiritual aspirations, but he found it profitable, For as Ben Franklin said, with such urbanity: 'Nothing will pay thee, friend, like Christianity.' And in our day thus saith the Evangelist: 'Tent preachin' is the kind that pays the best.'  'Twas as a business asset pure an\u2019 simple That Radway joined the Baptist Broadway Temple.  I find no moral for a peroration, He is the prototype of half the nation. \r\n                         \n", "Yeux Glauques": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Gladstone was still respected, When John Ruskin produced 'King's Treasuries'; Swinburne And Rossetti still abused.

Now I remember that you built me a special tavern By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin. With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs and laughter And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the kings and princes. Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from the west border, And with them, and with you especially There was nothing at cross purpose, And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain- crossing, If only they could be of that fellowship, And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without regret. And when I was sent off to South Wei, smothered in laurel groves, And you to the north of Raku-hoku, Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common. And then, when separation had come to its worst, We met, and travelled into Sen-Go, Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting waters, Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers, That was the first valley; And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and pine- winds. And with silver harness and reins of gold, Out came the East of Kan foreman and his company. And there came also the \u2018True man\u2019 of Shi-yo to meet me, Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ. In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more Sennin music, Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix broods. The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced because his long sleeves wouldn't keep still With that music playing, And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap, And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens, And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars, or rain. I had to be off to So, far away over the waters, You back to your river-bridge.  And your father, who was brave as a leopard, Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian rabble. And one May he had you send for me, despite the long distance. And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it wasn't hard going, Over roads twisted like sheep's guts. And I was still going, late in the year, in the cutting wind from the North, And thinking how little you cared for the cost, and you caring enough to pay it. And what a reception: Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table, And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning. And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle, To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as blue jade, With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums, With ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the water, Pleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming without hindrance, With the willow flakes falling like snow, And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset, And the water, a hundred feet deep, reflecting green eyebrows Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight, Gracefully painted And the girls singing back at each other, Dancing in transparent brocade, And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it, Tossing it up under the clouds. And all this comes to an end. And is not again to be met with. I went up to the court for examination, Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song, And got no promotion, and went back to the East Mountains White-headed. And once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head. And then the crowd broke up, you went north to San palace, And if you ask how I regret that parting: It is like the flowers falling at Spring's end Confused, whirled in a tangle. What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking, There is no end of things in the heart.

Was Venus exacerbated by the existence of a comparable equal? Is the ornamental goddess full of envy? Have you contempted Juno's Pelasgian temples, Have you denied Pallas good eyes ? Or is it my tongue that wrongs you with perpetual ascription of graces? There comes, it seems, and at any rate through perils, (so many) and of a vexed life, The gentler hour of an ultimate day.

II So thou hast forgotten fully That I so long held thy heart wholly, Thy little heart, so sweet and false and small That there's no thing more sweet or false at all.

While our fates twine together, sate we our eyes with love; For long night comes upon you and a day when no day returns. Let the gods lay chains upon us so that no day shall unbind them.  Fool who would set a term to love's madness, For the sun shall drive with black horses, earth shall bring wheat from barley, The flood shall move toward the fountain Ere love know moderations, The fish shall swim in dry streams. No, now while it may be, let not the fruit of life cease. Dry wreaths drop their petals, their stalks are woven in baskets, To-day we take the great breath of lovers, to-morrow fate shuts us in.
