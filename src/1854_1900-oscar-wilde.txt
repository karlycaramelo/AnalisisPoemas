{"Sonnet On Hearing The Dies Irae Sung In The Sistine Chapel": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Nay, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring, Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove, Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love Than terrors of red flame and thundering. The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring: A bird at evening flying to its nest Tells me of One who had no place of rest: I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing. Come rather on some autumn afternoon, When red and brown are burnished on the leaves, And the fields echo to the gleaner's song, Come when the splendid fulness of the moon Looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves, And reap Thy harvest: we have waited long. \r\n                         \n", "Humanitad": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                           IT is full Winter now: the trees are bare,      Save where the cattle huddle from the cold    Beneath the pine, for it doth never wear      The Autumn's gaudy livery whose gold    Her jealous brother pilfers, but is true    To the green doublet; bitter is the wind, as though it blew     From Saturn's cave; a few thin wisps of hay      Lie on the sharp black hedges, where the wain    Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer's day      From the low meadows up the narrow lane;    Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep    Press close against the hurdles, and the shivering house-dogs creep     From the shut stable to the frozen stream      And back again disconsolate, and miss    The bawling shepherds and the noisy team;      And overhead in circling listlessness    The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack,    Or crowd the dripping boughs; and in the fen the ice-pools crack     Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds      And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,    And hoots to see the moon; across the meads      Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;    And a stray seamew with its fretful cry    Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky.     Full winter: and the lusty goodman brings      His load of faggots from the chilly byre,    And stamps his feet upon the hearth, and flings      The sappy billets on the waning fire,    And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare    His children at their play; and yet,--the Spring is in the air,     Already the slim crocus stirs the snow,      And soon yon blanch\u00e8d fields will bloom again    With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow,      For with the first warm kisses of the rain    The winter's icy sorrow breaks to tears,    And the brown thrushes mate, and with bright eyes the rabbit peers     From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie,      And treads one snowdrop under foot, and runs    Over the mossy knoll, and blackbirds fly      Across our path at evening, and the suns    Stay longer with us; ah! how good to see    Grass-girdled Spring in all her joy of laughing greenery     Dance through the hedges till the early rose,      (That sweet repentance of the thorny briar!)    Burst from its sheath\u00e8d emerald and disclose      The little quivering disk of golden fire    Which the bees know so well, for with it come    Pale boys-love, sops-in-wine, and daffadillies all in bloom.     Then up and down the field the sower goes,      While close behind the laughing younker scares    With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows,      And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears,    And on the grass the creamy blossom falls    In odorous excess, and faint half-whispered madrigals     Steal from the bluebells' nodding carillons      Each breezy morn, and then white jessamine,    That star of its own heaven, snapdragons      With lolling crimson tongues, and eglantine    In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed    And woodland empery, and when the lingering rose hath shed     Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,      And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,    Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy      Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,    And violets getting overbold withdraw    From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw.     O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!      Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock    And crown of flowre-de-luce trip down the lea,      Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock    Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon    Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at          noon.     Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,      The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns    Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture      Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations    With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,    And straggling traveller's joy each hedge with yellow stars will          bind.     Dear Bride of Nature and most bounteous Spring!      That can'st give increase to the sweet-breath'd kine,    And to the kid its little horns, and bring      The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,    Where is that old nepenthe which of yore    Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!     There was a time when any common bird      Could make me sing in unison, a time    When all the strings of boyish life were stirred      To quick response or more melodious rhyme    By every forest idyll;--do I change?    Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?     Nay, nay, thou art the same: 'tis I who seek      To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,    And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek      Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;    Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare    To taint such wine with the salt poison of his own despair!     Thou art the same: 'tis I whose wretched soul      Takes discontent to be its paramour,    And gives its kingdom to the rude control      Of what should be its servitor,--for sure    Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea    Contain it not, and the huge deep answer ''Tis not in me.'     To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect      In natural honour, not to bend the knee    In profitless prostrations whose effect      Is by itself condemned, what alchemy    Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed    Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?     The minor chord which ends the harmony,      And for its answering brother waits in vain,    Sobbing for incompleted melody      Dies a Swan's death; but I the heir of pain    A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes    Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.     The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,      The little dust stored in the narrow urn,    The gentle XAIPE of the Attic tomb,--      Were not these better far than to return    To my old fitful restless malady,    Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?     Nay! for perchance that poppy-crown\u00e8d God      Is like the watcher by a sick man's bed    Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod      Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,    Death is too rude, too obvious a key    To solve one single secret in a life's philosophy.     And Love! that noble madness, whose august      And inextinguishable might can slay    The soul with honied drugs,--alas! I must      From such sweet ruin play the runaway,    Although too constant memory never can    Forget the arch\u00e8d splendour of those brows Olympian     Which for a little season made my youth      So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence    That all the chiding of more prudent Truth      Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,--O Hence    Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!    Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss     My lips have drunk enough,--no more, no more,--      Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow    Back to the troubled waters of this shore      Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now    The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,    Hence! Hence! I pass unto a life more barren, more austere.     More barren--ay, those arms will never lean      Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul    In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;      Some other head must wear that aureole,    For I am Hers who loves not any man    Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.     Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,      And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,    With net and spear and hunting equipage      Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,    But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell    Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel.     Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy      Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud    Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy      And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed    In wonder at her feet, not for the sake    Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.     Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!      And, if my lips be musicless, inspire    At least my life: was not thy glory hymned      By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre    Like \u00c6schylus at well-fought Marathon,    And died to show that Milton's England still could bear a son!     And yet I cannot tread the Portico      And live without desire, fear, and pain,    Or nurture that wise calm which long ago      The grave Athenian master taught to men,    Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,    To watch the world's vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.     Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,      Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,    Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse      Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne    Is childless; in the night which she had made    For lofty secure flight Athena's owl itself hath strayed.     Nor much with Science do I care to climb,      Although by strange and subtle witchery    She draw the moon from heaven: the Muse of Time      Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry    To no less eager eyes; often indeed    In the great epic of Polymnia's scroll I love to read     How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war      Against a little town, and panoplied    In gilded mail with jewelled scimetar,      White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede    Between the waving poplars and the sea    Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopyl\u00e6     Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,      And on the nearer side a little brood    Of careless lions holding festival!      And stood amaz\u00e8d at such hardihood,    And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,    And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o'er     Some unfrequented height, and coming down      The autumn forests treacherously slew    What Sparta held most dear and was the crown      Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew    How God had staked an evil net for him    In the small bay of Salamis,--and yet, the page grows dim,     Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel      With such a goodly time too out of tune    To love it much: for like the Dial's wheel      That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon    Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes    Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.     O for one grand unselfish simple life      To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills    Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife      Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,    Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly    Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!     Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is He      Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul    Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty      Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal    Where Love and Duty mingle! Him at least    The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom's feast,     But we are Learning's changelings, know by rote      The clarion watchword of each Grecian school    And follow none, the flawless sword which smote      The pagan Hydra is an effete tool    Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now    Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?     One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!      Gone is that last dear son of Italy,    Who being man died for the sake of God,      And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully.    O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,    Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour     Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or      The Arno with its tawny troubled gold    O'erleap its marge, no mightier conqueror      Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old    When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty    Walked like a Bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery     Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell      With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,    Fled shuddering for that immemorial knell      With which oblivion buries dynasties    Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,    As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.     He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,      He drave the base wolf from the lion's lair,    And now lies dead by that empyreal dome      Which overtops Valdarno hung in air    By Brunelleschi--O Melpomene    Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!     Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies      That Joy's self may grow jealous, and the Nine    Forget a-while their discreet emperies,      Mourning for him who on Rome's lordliest shrine    Lit for men's lives the light of Marathon,    And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!     O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,      Let some young Florentine each eventide    Bring coronals of that enchanted flower      Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,    And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies    Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes.     Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,      Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim    Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings      Of the eternal chanting Cherubim    Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away    Into a moonless void,--and yet, though he is dust and clay,     He is not dead, the immemorial Fates      Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain,    Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!      Ye argent clarions sound a loftier strain!    For the vile thing he hated lurks within    Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin.     Still what avails it that she sought her cave      That murderous mother of red harlotries?    At Munich on the marble architrave      The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas    Which wash \u00c6gina fret in loneliness    Not mirroring their beauty, so our lives grow colourless     For lack of our ideals, if one star      Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust    Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war      Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust    Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe    For all her stony sorrows hath her sons, but Italy!     What Easter Day shall make her children rise,      Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet    Shall find their graveclothes folded? what clear eyes      Shall see them bodily? O it were meet    To roll the stone from off the sepulchre    And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of Her     Our Italy! our mother visible!      Most blessed among nations and most sad,    For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell      That day at Aspromonte and was glad    That in an age when God was bought and sold    One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,      See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves      Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty    Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives      Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,    And no word said:--O we are wretched men    Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen     Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword      Which slew its master righteously? the years    Have lost their ancient leader, and no word      Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:    While as a ruined mother in some spasm    Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm     Genders unlawful children, Anarchy      Freedom's own Judas, the vile prodigal    Licence who steals the gold of Liberty      And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real    One Fratricide since Cain, Envy the asp    That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp     Is in its extent stiffened, monied Greed      For whose dull appetite men waste away    Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed      Of things which slay their sower, these each day    Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet    Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.     What even Cromwell spared is desecrated      By weed and worm, left to the stormy play    Of wind and beating snow, or renovated      By more destructful hands: Time's worst decay    Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,    But these new Vandals can but make a rainproof barrenness.     Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing      Through Lincoln's lofty choir, till the air    Seems from such marble harmonies to ring      With sweeter song than common lips can dare    To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now    The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow     For Southwell's arch, and carved the House of One      Who loved the lilies of the field with all    Our dearest English flowers? the same sun      Rises for us: the seasons natural    Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:    The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.     And yet perchance it may be better so,      For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,    Murder her brother is her bedfellow,      And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene    And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;    Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!     For gentle brotherhood, the harmony      Of living in the healthful air, the swift    Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free      And women chaste, these are the things which lift    Our souls up more than even Agnolo's    Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o'er the scroll of human woes,     Or Titian's little maiden on the stair      White as her own sweet lily and as tall,    Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,--      Ah! somehow life is bigger after all    Than any painted angel could we see    The God that is within us! The old Greek serenity     Which curbs the passion of that level line      Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes    And chastened limbs ride round Athena's shrine      And mirror her divine economies,    And balanced symmetry of what in man    Would else wage ceaseless warfare,--this at least within the span     Between our mother's kisses and the grave      Might so inform our lives, that we could win    Such mighty empires that from her cave      Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin    Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,    And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.     To make the Body and the Spirit one      With all right things, till no thing live in vain    From morn to noon, but in sweet unison      With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain    The Soul in flawless essence high enthroned,    Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,     Mark with serene impartiality      The strife of things, and yet be comforted,    Knowing that by the chain causality      All separate existences are wed    Into one supreme whole, whose utterance    Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance     Of Life in most august omnipresence,      Through which the rational intellect would find    In passion its expression, and mere sense,      Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,    And being joined with in harmony    More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,     Strike from their several tones one octave chord      Whose cadence being measureless would fly    Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord      Return refreshed with its new empery    And more exultant power,--this indeed    Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed.     Ah! it was easy when the world was young      To keep one's life free and inviolate,    From our sad lips another song is rung,      By our own hands our heads are desecrate,    Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed    Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.     Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,      And of all men we are most wretched who    Must live each other's lives and not our own      For very pity's sake and then undo    All that we live for--it was otherwise    When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.     But we have left those gentle haunts to pass      With weary feet to the new Calvary,    Where we behold, as one who in a glass      Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,    And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze    Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.     O smitten mouth! O forehead crowned with thorn!      O chalice of all common miseries!    Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne      An agony of endless centuries,    And we were vain and ignorant nor knew    That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we          slew.     Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,      The night that covers and the lights that fade,    The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,      The lips betraying and the life betrayed;    The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we    Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.     Is this the end of all that primal force      Which, in its changes being still the same,    From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,      Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,    Till the suns met in heaven and began    Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!     Nay, nay, we are but crucified and though      The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain,    Loosen the nails--we shall come down I know,      Staunch the red wounds--we shall be whole again,    No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,    That which is purely human, that is Godlike, that is God. \r\n                         \n", "La Mer": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        A white mist drifts across the shrouds, A wild moon in this wintry sky Gleams like an angry lion's eye Out of a mane of tawny clouds.

Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows,      The woods of white Colonos are not here,    On our bleak hills the olive never blows,      No simple priest conducts his lowing steer    Up the steep marble way, nor through the town    Do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.     Yet tarry! for the boy who loved thee best,      Whose very name should be a memory    To make thee linger, sleeps in silent rest      Beneath the Roman walls, and melody    Still mourns her sweetest lyre, none can play    The lute of Adonais, with his lips Song passed away.     Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left      One silver voice to sing his threnody,    But ah! too soon of it we were bereft      When on that riven night and stormy sea    Panthea claimed her singer as her own,    And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,     Save for that fiery heart, that morning star      Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye    Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war      The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy    Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring    The great Republic! him at least thy love hath taught to sing,     And he hath been with thee at Thessaly,     And seen white Atalanta fleet of foot    In passionless and fierce virginity      Hunting the tusk\u00e9d boar, his honied lute    Hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill,    And Venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still.     And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine,      And sung the Galil\u00e6an's requiem,    That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine      He hath discrowned, the Ancient Gods in him    Have found their last, most ardent worshipper,    And the new Sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror.     Spirit of Beauty! tarry with us still,      It is not quenched the torch of poesy,    The star that shook above the Eastern hill      Holds unassailed its argent armoury    From all the gathering gloom and fretful fight--    O tarry with us still! for through the long and common night,     Morris, our sweet and simple Chaucer's child,      Dear heritor of Spenser's tuneful reed,    With soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled      The weary soul of man in troublous need,    And from the far and flowerless fields of ice    Has brought fair flowers meet to make an earthly paradise.     We know them all, Gudrun the strong men's bride,      Aslaug and Olafson we know them all,    How giant Grettir fought and Sigurd died,      And what enchantment held the king in thrall    When lonely Brynhild wrestled with the powers    That war against all passion, ah! how oft through summer hours,     Long listless summer hours when the noon      Being enamoured of a damask rose    Forgets to journey westward, till the moon      The pale usurper of its tribute grows    From a thin sickle to a silver shield    And chides its loitering car--how oft, in some cool grassy field     Far from the cricket-ground and noisy eight,      At Bagley, where the rustling bluebells come    Almost before the blackbird finds a mate      And overstay the swallow, and the hum    Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves,    Have I lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves,     And through their unreal woes and mimic pain      Wept for myself, and so was purified,    And in their simple mirth grew glad again;      For as I sailed upon that pictured tide    The strength and splendour of the storm was mine    Without the storm's red ruin, for the singer is divine,     The little laugh of water falling down      Is not so musical, the clammy gold    Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town      Has less of sweetness in it, and the old    Half-withered reeds that waved in Arcady    Touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony.     Spirit of Beauty tarry yet a-while!      Although the cheating merchants of the mart    With iron roads profane our lovely isle,      And break on whirling wheels the limbs of Art,    Ay! though the crowded factories beget    The blind-worm Ignorance that slays the soul, O tarry yet!     For One at least there is,--He bears his name      From Dante and the seraph Gabriel,--    Whose double laurels burn with deathless flame      To light thine altar; He too loves thee well,    Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien's snare,    And the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair,     Loves thee so well, that all the World for him      A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,    And Sorrow take a purple diadem,      Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair    Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be    Even in anguish beautiful;--such is the empery     Which Painters hold, and such the heritage      This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,    Being a better mirror of his age      In all his pity, love, and weariness,    Than those who can but copy common things,    And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.     But they are few, and all romance has flown,      And men can prophesy about the sun,    And lecture on his arrows--how, alone,      Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,    How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,    And that no more 'mid English reeds a Na\u00efad shows her head.     Methinks these new Act\u00e6ons boast too soon      That they have spied on beauty; what if we    Have analyzed the rainbow, robbed the moon      Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,    Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope    Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!     What profit if this scientific age      Burst through our gates with all its retinue    Of modern miracles! Can it assuage      One lover's breaking heart? what can it do    To make one life more beautiful, one day    More god-like in its period? but now the Age of Clay     Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth      Hath borne again a noisy progeny    Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth      Hurls them against the august hierarchy    Which sat upon Olympus, to the Dust    They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must     Repair for judgment, let them, if they can,      From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,    Create the new Ideal rule for man!      Methinks that was not my inheritance;    For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul    Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal.     Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away      Her visage from the God, and Hecate's boat    Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day      Blew all its torches out: I did not note    The waning hours, to young Endymions    Time's palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!--     Mark how the yellow iris wearily      Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed    By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly,      Who, like a blue vein on a girl's white wrist,    Sleeps on that snowy primrose of the night,    Which 'gins to flush with crimson shame, and die beneath the light.     Come let us go, against the pallid shield      Of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam,    The corn-crake nested in the unmown field      Answers its mate, across the misty stream    On fitful wing the startled curlews fly,    And in his sedgy bed the lark, for joy that Day is nigh,     Scatters the pearl\u00e9d dew from off the grass,      In tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun,    Who soon in gilded panoply will pass      Forth from yon orange-curtained pavilion    Hung in the burning east, see, the red rim    O'ertops the expectant hills! it is the God! for love of him     Already the shrill lark is out of sight,      Flooding with waves of song this silent dell,--    Ah! there is something more in that bird's flight      Than could be tested in a crucible!--    But the air freshens, let us go,--why soon    The woodmen will be here; how we have lived this night of June! \r\n                         \n", "Madonna Mia": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                                  A LILY-GIRL, not made for this world's pain,             With brown, soft hair close braided by her ears,             And longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears           Like bluest water seen through mists of rain:           Pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain,             Red underlip drawn in for fear of love,             And white throat, whiter than the silvered dove,           Through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein.           Yet, though my lips shall praise her without cease,             Even to kiss her feet I am not bold,             Being o'ershadowed by the wings of awe.

She is too fair for any man                   To see or hold his heart's delight,                 Fairer than Queen or courtezan                   Or moon-lit water in the night.

He walked amongst the Trial Men  In a suit of shabby gray;  A cricket cap was on his head,  And his step seemed light and gay;  But I never saw a man who looked  So wistfully at the day.    I never saw a man who looked  With such a wistful eye  Upon that little tent of blue  Which prisoners call the sky,  And at every drifting cloud that went  With sails of silver by.    I walked, with other souls in pain,  Within another ring,  And was wondering if the man had done  A great or little thing,  When a voice behind me whispered low,  'That fellow's got to swing.'    Dear Christ! the very prison walls  Suddenly seemed to reel,  And the sky above my head became  Like a casque of scorching steel;  And, though I was a soul in pain,  My pain I could not feel.    I only knew what haunted thought  Quickened his step, and why  He looked upon the garish day  With such a wistful eye;  The man had killed the thing he loved,  And so he had to die.    Yet each man kills the thing he loves,  By each let this be heard,  Some do it with a bitter look,  Some with a flattering word,  The coward does it with a kiss,  The brave man with a sword!    Some kill their love when they are young,  And some when they are old;  Some strangle with the hands of Lust,  Some with the hands of Gold:  The kindest use a knife, because  The dead so soon grow cold.    Some love too little, some too long,  Some sell, and others buy;  Some do the deed with many tears,  And some without a sigh:  For each man kills the thing he loves,  Yet each man does not die.    He does not die a death of shame  On a day of dark disgrace,  Nor have a noose about his neck,  Nor a cloth upon his face,  Nor drop feet foremost through the floor  Into an empty space.    He does not sit with silent men  Who watch him night and day;  Who watch him when he tries to weep,  And when he tries to pray;  Who watch him lest himself should rob  The prison of its prey.    He does not wake at dawn to see  Dread figures throng his room,  The shivering Chaplain robed in white,  The Sheriff stern with gloom,  And the Governor all in shiny black,  With the yellow face of Doom.    He does not rise in piteous haste  To put on convict-clothes,  While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes  Each new and nerve-twitched pose,  Fingering a watch whose little ticks  Are like horrible hammer-blows.    He does not feel that sickening thirst  That sands one's throat, before  The hangman with his gardener's gloves  Comes through the padded door,  And binds one with three leathern thongs,  That the throat may thirst no more.    He does not bend his head to hear  The Burial Office read,  Nor, while the anguish of his soul  Tells him he is not dead,  Cross his own coffin, as he moves  Into the hideous shed.    He does not stare upon the air  Through a little roof of glass:  He does not pray with lips of clay  For his agony to pass;  Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek  The kiss of Caiaphas.    II  Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard,  In the suit of shabby gray:  His cricket cap was on his head,  And his step was light and gay,  But I never saw a man who looked  So wistfully at the day.    I never saw a man who looked  With such a wistful eye  Upon that little tent of blue  Which prisoners call the sky,  And at every wandering cloud that trailed  Its ravelled fleeces by.    He did not wring his hands, as do  Those witless men who dare  To try to rear the changeling Hope  In the cave of black Despair:  He only looked upon the sun,  And drank the morning air.    He did not wring his hands nor weep,  Nor did he peek or pine,  But he drank the air as though it held  Some healthful anodyne;  With open mouth he drank the sun  As though it had been wine!    And I and all the souls in pain,  Who tramped the other ring,  Forgot if we ourselves had done  A great or little thing,  And watched with gaze of dull amaze  The man who had to swing.    For strange it was to see him pass  With a step so light and gay,  And strange it was to see him look  So wistfully at the day,  And strange it was to think that he  Had such a debt to pay.    The oak and elm have pleasant leaves  That in the spring-time shoot:  But grim to see is the gallows-tree,  With its alder-bitten root,  And, green or dry, a man must die  Before it bears its fruit!    The loftiest place is the seat of grace  For which all worldlings try:  But who would stand in hempen band  Upon a scaffold high,  And through a murderer's collar take  His last look at the sky?    It is sweet to dance to violins  When Love and Life are fair:  To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes  Is delicate and rare:  But it is not sweet with nimble feet  To dance upon the air!    So with curious eyes and sick surmise  We watched him day by day,  And wondered if each one of us  Would end the self-same way,  For none can tell to what red Hell  His sightless soul may stray.    At last the dead man walked no more  Amongst the Trial Men,  And I knew that he was standing up  In the black dock's dreadful pen,  And that never would I see his face  For weal or woe again.    Like two doomed ships that pass in storm  We had crossed each other's way:  But we made no sign, we said no word,  We had no word to say;  For we did not meet in the holy night,  But in the shameful day.    A prison wall was round us both,  Two outcast men we were:  The world had thrust us from its heart,  And God from out His care:  And the iron gin that waits for Sin  Had caught us in its snare.    III  In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,  And the dripping wall is high,  So it was there he took the air  Beneath the leaden sky,  And by each side a warder walked,  For fear the man might die.    Or else he sat with those who watched  His anguish night and day;  Who watched him when he rose to weep,  And when he crouched to pray;  Who watched him lest himself should rob  Their scaffold of its prey.    The Governor was strong upon  The Regulations Act:  The Doctor said that Death was but  A scientific fact:  And twice a day the Chaplain called,  And left a little tract.    And twice a day he smoked his pipe,  And drank his quart of beer:  His soul was resolute, and held  No hiding-place for fear;  He often said that he was glad  The hangman's day was near.    But why he said so strange a thing  No warder dared to ask:  For he to whom a watcher's doom  Is given as his task,  Must set a lock upon his lips,  And make his face a mask.    Or else he might be moved, and try  To comfort or console:  And what should Human Pity do  Pent up in Murderers' Hole?  What word of grace in such a place  Could help a brother's soul?    With slouch and swing around the ring  We trod the Fools' Parade!  We did not care: we knew we were  The Devils' Own Brigade:  And shaven head and feet of lead  Make a merry masquerade.    We tore the tarry rope to shreds  With blunt and bleeding nails;  We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,  And cleaned the shining rails:  And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,  And clattered with the pails.    We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,  We turned the dusty drill:  We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,  And sweated on the mill:  But in the heart of every man  Terror was lying still.    So still it lay that every day  Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:  And we forgot the bitter lot  That waits for fool and knave,  Till once, as we tramped in from work,  We passed an open grave.    With yawning mouth the horrid hole  Gaped for a living thing;  The very mud cried out for blood  To the thirsty asphalte ring:  And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair  The fellow had to swing.    Right in we went, with soul intent  On Death and Dread and Doom:  The hangman, with his little bag,  Went shuffling through the gloom:  And I trembled as I groped my way  Into my numbered tomb.    That night the empty corridors  Were full of forms of Fear,  And up and down the iron town  Stole feet we could not hear,  And through the bars that hide the stars  White faces seemed to peer.    He lay as one who lies and dreams  In a pleasant meadow-land,  The watchers watched him as he slept,  And could not understand  How one could sleep so sweet a sleep  With a hangman close at hand.    But there is no sleep when men must weep  Who never yet have wept:  So we- the fool, the fraud, the knave-  That endless vigil kept,  And through each brain on hands of pain  Another's terror crept.    Alas! it is a fearful thing  To feel another's guilt!  For, right within, the sword of Sin  Pierced to its poisoned hilt,  And as molten lead were the tears we shed  For the blood we had not spilt.    The warders with their shoes of felt  Crept by each padlocked door,  And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,  Gray figures on the floor,  And wondered why men knelt to pray  Who never prayed before.    All through the night we knelt and prayed,  Mad mourners of a corse!  The troubled plumes of midnight shook  Like the plumes upon a hearse:  And as bitter wine upon a sponge  Was the savour of Remorse.    The gray cock crew, the red cock crew,  But never came the day:  And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,  In the corners where we lay:  And each evil sprite that walks by night  Before us seemed to play.    They glided past, the glided fast,  Like travellers through a mist:  They mocked the moon in a rigadoon  Of delicate turn and twist,  And with formal pace and loathsome grace  The phantoms kept their tryst.    With mop and mow, we saw them go,  Slim shadows hand in hand:  About, about, in ghostly rout  They trod a saraband:  And the damned grotesques made arabesques,  Like the wind upon the sand!    With the pirouettes of marionettes,  They tripped on pointed tread:  But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,  As their grisly masque they led,  And loud they sang, and long they sang,  For they sang to wake the dead.    'Oho! ' they cried, 'the world is wide,  But fettered limbs go lame!  And once, or twice, to throw the dice  Is a gentlemanly game,  But he does not win who plays with Sin  In the secret House of Shame.'    No things of air these antics were,  That frolicked with such glee:  To men whose lives were held in gyves,  And whose feet might not go free,  Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,  Most terrible to see.    Around, around, they waltzed and wound;  Some wheeled in smirking pairs;  With the mincing step of a demirep  Some sidled up the stairs:  And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,  Each helped us at our prayers.    The morning wind began to moan,  But still the night went on:  Through its giant loom the web of gloom  Crept till each thread was spun:  And, as we prayed, we grew afraid  Of the Justice of the Sun.    The moaning wind went wandering round  The weeping prison wall:  Till like a wheel of turning steel  We felt the minutes crawl:  O moaning wind! what had we done  To have such a seneschal?    At last I saw the shadowed bars,  Like a lattice wrought in lead,  Move right across the whitewashed wall  That faced my three-plank bed,  And I knew that somewhere in the world  God's dreadful dawn was red.    At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,  At seven all was still,  But the sough and swing of a mighty wing  The prison seemed to fill,  For the Lord of Death with icy breath  Had entered in to kill.    He did not pass in purple pomp,  Nor ride a moon-white steed.  Three yards of cord and a sliding board  Are all the gallows' need:  So with rope of shame the Herald came  To do the secret deed.    We were as men who through a fen  Of filthy darkness grope:  We did not dare to breathe a prayer,  Or to give our anguish scope:  Something was dead in each of us,  And what was dead was Hope.    For Man's grim Justice goes its way  And will not swerve aside:  It slays the weak, it slays the strong,  It has a deadly stride:  With iron heel it slays the strong  The monstrous parricide!    We waited for the stroke of eight:  Each tongue was thick with thirst:  For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate  That makes a man accursed,  And Fate will use a running noose  For the best man and the worst.    We had no other thing to do,  Save to wait for the sign to come:  So, like things of stone in a valley lone,  Quiet we sat and dumb:  But each man's heart beat thick and quick,  Like a madman on a drum!    With sudden shock the prison-clock  Smote on the shivering air,  And from all the gaol rose up a wail  Of impotent despair,  Like the sound the frightened marshes hear  From some leper in his lair.    And as one sees most fearful things  In the crystal of a dream,  We saw the greasy hempen rope  Hooked to the blackened beam,  And heard the prayer the hangman's snare  Strangled into a scream.    And all the woe that moved him so  That he gave that bitter cry,  And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,  None knew so well as I:  For he who lives more lives than one  More deaths that one must die.    IV  There is no chapel on the day  On which they hang a man:  The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,  Or his face is far too wan,  Or there is that written in his eyes  Which none should look upon.    So they kept us close till nigh on noon,  And then they rang the bell,  And the warders with their jingling keys  Opened each listening cell,  And down the iron stair we tramped,  Each from his separate Hell.    Out into God's sweet air we went,  But not in wonted way,  For this man's face was white with fear,  And that man's face was gray,  And I never saw sad men who looked  So wistfully at the day.    I never saw sad men who looked  With such a wistful eye  Upon that little tent of blue  We prisoners called the sky,  And at every happy cloud that passed  In such strange freedom by.    But there were those amongst us all  Who walked with downcast head,  And knew that, had each got his due,  They should have died instead:  He had but killed a thing that lived,  Whilst they had killed the dead.    For he who sins a second time  Wakes a dead soul to pain,  And draws it from its spotted shroud  And makes it bleed again,  And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,  And makes it bleed in vain!    Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb  With crooked arrows starred,  Silently we went round and round  The slippery asphalte yard;  Silently we went round and round,  And no man spoke a word.    Silently we went round and round,  And through each hollow mind  The Memory of dreadful things  Rushed like a dreadful wind,  And Horror stalked before each man,  And Terror crept behind.    The warders strutted up and down,  And watched their herd of brutes,  Their uniforms were spick and span,  And they wore their Sunday suits,  But we knew the work they had been at,  By the quicklime on their boots.    For where a grave had opened wide,  There was no grave at all:  Only a stretch of mud and sand  By the hideous prison-wall,  And a little heap of burning lime,  That the man should have his pall.    For he has a pall, this wretched man,  Such as few men can claim:  Deep down below a prison-yard,  Naked, for greater shame,  He lies, with fetters on each foot,  Wrapt in a sheet of flame!    And all the while the burning lime  Eats flesh and bone away,  It eats the brittle bones by night,  And the soft flesh by day,  It eats the flesh and bone by turns,  But it eats the heart alway.    For three long years they will not sow  Or root or seedling there:  For three long years the unblessed spot  Will sterile be and bare,  And look upon the wondering sky  With unreproachful stare.    They think a murderer's heart would taint  Each simple seed they sow.  It is not true! God's kindly earth  Is kindlier than men know,  And the red rose would but glow more red,  The white rose whiter blow.    Out of his mouth a red, red rose!  Out of his heart a white!  For who can say by what strange way,  Christ brings His will to light,  Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore  Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?    But neither milk-white rose nor red  May bloom in prison air;  The shard, the pebble, and the flint,  Are what they give us there:  For flowers have been known to heal  A common man's despair.    So never will wine-red rose or white,  Petal by petal, fall  On that stretch of mud and sand that lies  By the hideous prison-wall,  To tell the men who tramp the yard  That God's Son died for all.    Yet though the hideous prison-wall  Still hems him round and round,  And a spirit may not walk by night  That is with fetters bound,  And a spirit may but weep that lies  In such unholy ground,    He is at peace- this wretched man-  At peace, or will be soon:  There is no thing to make him mad,  Nor does Terror walk at noon,  For the lampless Earth in which he lies  Has neither Sun nor Moon.    They hanged him as a beast is hanged:  They did not even toll  A requiem that might have brought  Rest to his startled soul,  But hurriedly they took him out,  And hid him in a hole.    The warders stripped him of his clothes,  And gave him to the flies:  They mocked the swollen purple throat,  And the stark and staring eyes:  And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud  In which the convict lies.    The Chaplain would not kneel to pray  By his dishonoured grave:  Nor mark it with that blessed Cross  That Christ for sinners gave,  Because the man was one of those  Whom Christ came down to save.    Yet all is well; he has but passed  To Life's appointed bourne:  And alien tears will fill for him  Pity's long-broken urn,  For his mourners be outcast men,  And outcasts always mourn.    V  I know not whether Laws be right,  Or whether Laws be wrong;  All that we know who lie in gaol  Is that the wall is strong;  And that each day is like a year,  A year whose days are long.    But this I know, that every Law  That men have made for Man,  Since first Man took His brother's life,  And the sad world began,  But straws the wheat and saves the chaff  With a most evil fan.    This too I know- and wise it were  If each could know the same-  That every prison that men build  Is built with bricks of shame,  And bound with bars lest Christ should see  How men their brothers maim.    With bars they blur the gracious moon,  And blind the goodly sun:  And the do well to hide their Hell,  For in it things are done  That Son of things nor son of Man  Ever should look upon!    The vilest deeds like poison weeds  Bloom well in prison-air:  It is only what is good in Man  That wastes and withers there:  Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,  And the warder is Despair.    For they starve the little frightened child  Till it weeps both night and day:  And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,  And gibe the old and gray,  And some grow mad, and all grow bad,  And none a word may say.    Each narrow cell in which we dwell  Is a foul and dark latrine,  And the fetid breath of living Death  Chokes up each grated screen,  And all, but Lust, is turned to dust  In Humanity's machine.    The brackish water that we drink  Creeps with a loathsome slime,  And the bitter bread they weigh in scales  Is full of chalk and lime,  And Sleep will not lie down, but walks  Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.    But though lean Hunger and green Thirst  Like asp with adder fight,  We have little care of prison fare,  For what chills and kills outright  Is that every stone one lifts by day  Becomes one's heart by night.    With midnight always in one's heart,  And twilight in one's cell,  We turn the crank, or tear the rope,  Each in his separate Hell,  And the silence is more awful far  Than the sound of a brazen bell.    And never a human voice comes near  To speak a gentle word:  And the eye that watches through the door  Is pitiless and hard:  And by all forgot, we rot and rot,  With soul and body marred.    And thus we rust Life's iron chain  Degraded and alone:  And some men curse, and some men weep,  And some men make no moan:  But God's eternal Laws are kind  And break the heart of stone.    And every human heart that breaks,  In prison-cell or yard,  Is as that broken box that gave  Its treasure to the Lord,  And filled the unclean leper's house  With the scent of costliest nard.    Ah! happy they whose hearts can break  And peace of pardon win!  How else may man make straight his plan  And cleanse his soul from Sin?  How else but through a broken heart  May Lord Christ enter in?    And he of the swollen purple throat,  And the stark and staring eyes,  Waits for the holy hands that took  The Thief to Paradise;  And a broken and a contrite heart  The Lord will not despise.    The man in red who reads the Law  Gave him three weeks of life,  Three little weeks in which to heal  His soul of his soul's strife,  And cleanse from every blot of blood  The hand that held the knife.    And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,  The hand that held the steel:  For only blood can wipe out blood,  And only tears can heal:  And the crimson stain that was of Cain  Became Christ's snow-white seal.    VI  In Reading gaol by Reading town  There is a pit of shame,  And in it lies a wretched man  Eaten by teeth of flame,  In a burning winding-sheet he lies,  And his grave has got no name.    And there, till Christ call forth the dead,  In silence let him lie:  No need to waste the foolish tear,  Or heave the windy sigh:  The man had killed the thing he loved,  And so he had to die.    And all men kill the thing they love,  By all let this be heard,  Some do it with a bitter look,  Some with a flattering word,  The coward does it with a kiss,  The brave man with a sword! \r\n                         \n", "Ballade De Marguerite (Normande)": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        I am weary of lying within the chase When the knights are meeting in market-place.  Nay, go not thou to the red-roofed town Lest the hoofs of the war-horse tread thee down.  But I would not go where the Squires ride, I would only walk by my Lady's side.  Alack! and alack! thou art overbold, A Forester's son may not eat off gold.  Will she love me the less that my Father is seen Each Martinmas day in a doublet green?  Perchance she is sewing at tapestrie, Spindle and loom are not meet for thee.  Ah, if she is working the arras bright I might ravel the threads by the fire-light.  Perchance she is hunting of the deer, How could you follow o'er hill and mere?  Ah, if she is riding with the court, I might run beside her and wind the morte.  Perchance she is kneeling in St. Denys, (On her soul may our Lady have gramercy!)  Ah, if she is praying in lone chapelle, I might swing the censer and ring the bell.

And the old priest put out the waning fires      Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed     For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres      Came fainter on the wind, as down the road    In joyous dance these country folk did pass,    And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.     Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,      And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,    And the rose-petals falling from the wreath      As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,    And seemed to be in some entranc\u00e8d swoon    Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon     Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,      When from his nook upleapt the venturous lad,    And flinging wide the cedar-carven door      Beheld an awful image saffron-clad    And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared    From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared     Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled      The Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,    And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,      And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold    In passion impotent, while with blind gaze    The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.     The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp      Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast    The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp      Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast    Divide the folded curtains of the night,    And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.     And guilty lovers in their venery      Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,     Deeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;      And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats    Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,    Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.     For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,      And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,    And the air quaked with dissonant alarums      Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,    And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,    And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.     Ready for death with parted lips he stood,      And well content at such a price to see    That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,      The marvel of that pitiless chastity,    Ah! well content indeed, for never wight    Since Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.     Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air      Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,    And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,      And from his limbs he threw the cloak away,     For whom would not such love make desperate,    And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate     Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,      And bared the breasts of polished ivory,    Till from the waist the peplos falling down      Left visible the secret mystery    Which to no lover will Athena show,    The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow.     Those who have never known a lover's sin      Let them not read my ditty, it will be    To their dull ears so musicless and thin      That they will have no joy of it, but ye    To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,    Ye who have learned who Eros is,--O listen yet a-while.     A little space he let his greedy eyes      Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight    Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,      And then his lips in hungering delight    Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck    He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.      Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,      For all night long he murmured honeyed word,    And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed      Her pale and argent body undisturbed,    And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed    His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.     It was as if Numidian javelins      Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,    And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins      In exquisite pulsation, and the pain    Was such sweet anguish that he never drew    His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.     They who have never seen the daylight peer      Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,    And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear      And worshipped body risen, they for certain    Will never know of what I try to sing,    How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.     The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,      The sign which shipmen say is ominous     Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,      And the low lightening east was tremulous    With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,    Ere from the silent sombre shrine this lover had withdrawn.     Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast      Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,    And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,      And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran    Like a young fawn unto an olive wood    Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood.      And sought a little stream, which well he knew,      For oftentimes with boyish careless shout    The green and crested grebe he would pursue,      Or snare in woven net the silver trout,    And down amid the startled reeds he lay    Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.     On the green bank he lay, and let one hand      Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,    And soon the breath of morning came and fanned      His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly    The tangled curls from off his forehead, while    He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.     And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak      With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,    And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke      Curled through the air across the ripening oats,    And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed    As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.     And when the light-foot mower went afield      Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,     And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,      And from its nest the waking corn-crake flew,    Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream    And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,     Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,      'It is young Hylas, that false runaway    Who with a Naiad now would make his bed      Forgetting Herakles,' but others, 'Nay,    It is Narcissus, his own paramour,    Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.'     And when they nearer came a third one cried,      'It is young Dionysos who has hid    His spear and fawnskin by the river side      Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,    And wise indeed were we away to fly    They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.'     So turned they back, and feared to look behind,      And told the timid swain how they had seen    Amid the reeds some woodland God reclined,      And no man dared to cross the open green,      And on that day no olive-tree was slain,    Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain.     Save when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail      Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound    Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail      Hoping that he some comrade new had found,    And gat no answer, and then half afraid    Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade     A little girl ran laughing from the farm      Not thinking of love's secret mysteries,     And when she saw the white and gleaming arm      And all his manlihood, with longing eyes    Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity    Watched him a-while, and then stole back sadly and wearily.     Far off he heard the city's hum and noise,      And now and then the shriller laughter where    The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys      Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,    And now and then a little tinkling bell    As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.      Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,      The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,    In sleek and oily coat the water-rat      Breasting the little ripples manfully    Made for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough    Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough.     On the faint wind floated the silky seeds,      As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,    The ousel-cock splashed circles in the reeds      And flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,     Which scarce had caught again its imagery    Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragonfly.     But little care had he for any thing      Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,    And from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing      To her brown mate her sweetest serenade,    Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen    The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.     But when the herdsman called his straggling goats      With whistling pipe across the rocky road,     And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes      Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode    Of coming storm, and the belated crane    Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain     Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,      And from the gloomy forest went his way    Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,      And came at last unto a little quay,    And called his mates a-board, and took his seat    On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping          sheet,     And steered across the bay, and when nine suns      Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,    And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons      To the chaste stars their confessors, or told    Their dearest secret to the downy moth    That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth     Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes      And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked    As though the lading of three argosies      Were in the hold, and flapped its wings, and shrieked,     And darkness straightway stole across the deep,    Sheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,     And the moon hid behind a tawny mask      Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge    Rose the red plume, the huge and horn\u00e8d casque,      The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!    And clad in bright and burnished panoply    Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!     To the dull sailors' sight her loosened locks      Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet    Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,      And marking how the rising waters beat    Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried    To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side.     But he, the over-bold adulterer,      A dear profaner of great mysteries,    An ardent amorous idolater,      When he beheld those grand relentless eyes    Laughed loud for joy, and crying out 'I come'    Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.     Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,      One dancer left the circling galaxy,    And back to Athens on her clattering car      In all the pride of venged divinity    Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,    And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.     And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew      With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,    And the old pilot bade the trembling crew      Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen    Close to the stern a dim and giant form,    And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.     And no man dared to speak of Charmides      Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,    And when they reached the strait Symplegades      They beached their galley on the shore, and sought    The toll-gate of the city hastily,    And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.                                    II.    But some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare      The boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,     And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair      And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand,    Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,    And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.     And when he neared his old Athenian home,      A mighty billow rose up suddenly    Upon whose oily back the clotted foam      Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,    And clasping him unto its glassy breast,    Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!     Now where Colonos leans unto the sea      There lies a long and level stretch of lawn,    The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee      For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun    Is not afraid, for never through the day    Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.     But often from the thorny labyrinth      And tangled branches of the circling wood    The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth      Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood    Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,    Nor dares to wind his horn, or--else at the first break of day     The Dyrads come and throw the leathern ball      Along the reedy shore, and circumvent    Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal      For fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,    And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,    Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.     On this side and on that a rocky cave,      Hung with the yellow-bell'd laburnum, stands,    Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave      Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,    As though it feared to be too soon forgot    By the green rush, its playfellow,--and yet, it is a spot     So small, that the inconstant butterfly      Could steal the hoarded honey from each flower    Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy      Its over-greedy love,--within an hour    A sailor boy, were he but rude enow    To land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,     Would almost leave the little meadow bare,      For it knows nothing of great pageantry,    Only a few narcissi here and there      Stand separate in sweet austerity,    Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,    And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimetars.     Hither the billow brought him, and was glad      Of such dear servitude, and where the land    Was virgin of all waters laid the lad      Upon the golden margent of the strand,     And like a lingering lover oft returned    To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,     Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,      That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,    Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost      Had withered up those lilies white and red    Which, while the boy would through the forest range,    Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counterchange.     And when at dawn the woodnymphs, hand-in-hand,      Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied     The boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,      And feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,    And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade,    Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.     Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be      So dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms    Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,      And longed to listen to those subtle charms    Insidious lovers weave when they would win    Some fenc\u00e8d fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin     To yield her treasure unto one so fair,      And lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,    Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,      And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth    Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid    Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,     Returned to fresh assault, and all day long      Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,    And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,      Then frowned to see how froward was the boy     Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,    Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine,     Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,      But said, 'He will awake, I know him well,    He will awake at evening when the sun      Hangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel,    This sleep is but a cruel treachery    To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea     Deeper than ever falls the fisher's line      Already a huge Triton blows his horn,    And weaves a garland from the crystalline      And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn    The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,    For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral-crown\u00e8d head,     We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,      And a blue wave will be our canopy,    And at our feet the water-snakes will curl      In all their amethystine panoply    Of diamonded mail, and we will mark    The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,     Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold      Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep    His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,      And we will see the painted dolphins sleep    Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks    Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.     And tremulous opal-hued anemones      Will wave their purple fringes where we tread    Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies      Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread    The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,    And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.'     But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun      With gaudy pennon flying passed away    Into his brazen House, and one by one      The little yellow stars began to stray    Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed    She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,     And cried, 'Awake, already the pale moon      Washes the trees with silver, and the wave    Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,      The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave    The night-jar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,    And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky          grass.     Nay, though thou art a God, be not so coy,      For in yon stream there is a little reed    That often whispers how a lovely boy      Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,    Who when his cruel pleasure he had done    Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.      Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still      With great Apollo's kisses, and the fir    Whose clustering sisters fringe the sea-ward hill      Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher    Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen    The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.     Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,      And every morn a young and ruddy swain    Wooes me with apples and with locks of hair,      And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain    By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;    But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove     With little crimson feet, which with its store      Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad    Had stolen from the lofty sycamore      At day-break, when her amorous comrade had    Flown off in search of berried juniper    Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager     Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency      So constant as this simple shepherd-boy     For my poor lips, his joyous purity      And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy    A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;    For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss,     His argent forehead, like a rising moon      Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,    Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon      Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse    For Cyther\u00e6a, the first silky down    Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and          brown:     And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds      Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,    And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds      Is in his homestead for the thievish fly    To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead    Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.     And yet I love him not, it was for thee      I kept my love, I knew that thou would'st come    To rid me of this pallid chastity;      Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam     Of all the wide \u00c6gean, brightest star    Of ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!     I knew that thou would'st come, for when at first      The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of Spring    Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst      To myriad multitudinous blossoming    Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons    That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous tunes     Startled the squirrel from its granary,      And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,     Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy      Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein    Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,    And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.     The trooping fawns at evening came and laid      Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs    And on my topmost branch the blackbird made      A little nest of grasses for his spouse,    And now and then a twittering wren would light    On a thin twig which hardly bare the weigh of such delight.     I was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,      Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,    And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase      The timorous girl, till tired out with play    She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,    And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare.     Then come away unto my ambuscade      Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy    For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade      Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify    The dearest rites of love, there in the cool    And green recesses of its farthest depth there is a pool,     The ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,      For round its rim great creamy lilies float    Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,      Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat    Steered by a dragon-fly,--be not afraid    To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place were made     For lovers such as we, the Cyprian Queen,      One arm around her boyish paramour,     Strays often there at eve, and I have seen      The moon strip off her misty vestiture    For young Endymion's eyes, be not afraid,    The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.     Nay if thou wil'st, back to the beating brine,      Back to the boisterous billow let us go,    And walk all day beneath the hyaline      Huge vault of Neptune's watery portico,    And watch the purple monsters of the deep    Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.      For if my mistress find me lying here      She will not ruth or gentle pity show,    But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere      Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,    And draw the feathered notch against her breast,    And loose the arch\u00e8d cord, ay, even now upon the quest     I hear her hurrying feet,--awake, awake,      Thou laggard in love's battle! once at least    Let me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake      My parch\u00e8d being with the nectarous feast     Which even Gods affect! O come Love come,    Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.'     Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees      Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air    Grew conscious of a God, and the grey seas      Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare    Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,    And like a flame a barb\u00e8d reed flew whizzing down the glade.     And where the little flowers of her breast      Just brake into their milky blossoming,     This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,      Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,    And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,    And dug a long red road, and cleft with wing\u00e8d death her heart.     Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry      On the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,    Sobbing for incomplete virginity,      And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,    And all the pain of things unsatisfied,    And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing           side.     Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,      And very pitiful to see her die    Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known      The joy of passion, that dread mystery    Which not to know is not to live at all,    And yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.     But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,      Who with Adonis all night long had lain    Within some shepherd's hut in Arcady,      On team of silver doves and gilded wane    Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar    From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,     And when low down she spied the hapless pair,      And heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,    Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air      As though it were a viol, hastily    She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,    And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous          doom.     For as a gardener turning back his head      To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows    With careless scythe too near some flower bed,      And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,    And with the flower's loosened loveliness    Strews the brown mould, or as some shepherd lad in wantonness     Driving his little flock along the mead      Treads down two daffodils which side by side    Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede      And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,    Treads down their brimming golden chalices    Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages,     Or as a schoolboy tired of his book      Flings himself down upon the reedy grass    And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,      And for a time forgets the hour glass,    Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,    And lets the hot sun kill them, even so these lovers lay.     And Venus cried, 'It is dread Artemis      Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,    Or else that mightier may whose care it is      To guard her strong and stainless majesty     Upon the hill Athenian,--alas!    That they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should pass.     So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl      In the great golden waggon tenderly,    Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl      Just threaded with a blue vein's tapestry    Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast    Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest.     And then each pigeon spread its milky van,      The bright car soared into the dawning sky,     And like a cloud the aerial caravan      Passed over the \u00c6gean silently,    Till the faint air was troubled with the song    From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.     But when the doves had reached their wonted goal      Where the wide stair of orb\u00e8d marble dips    Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul      Just shook the trembling petals of her lips    And passed into the void, and Venus knew    That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,      And bade her servants carve a cedar chest      With all the wonder of this history,    Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest      Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky    On the low hills of Paphos, and the faun    Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.     Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere      The morning bee had stung the daffodil    With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair      The waking stag had leapt across the rill     And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept    Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.     And when day brake, within that silver shrine      Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,    Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine      That she whose beauty made Death amorous    Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,    And let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.                                    III.    In melancholy moonless Acheron,      Far from the goodly earth and joyous day,     Where no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun      Weighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May    Chequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,    Where thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,     There by a dim and dark Leth\u00e6an well      Young Charmides was lying, wearily    He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,      And with its little rifled treasury    Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,    And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a          dream,     When as he gazed into the watery glass      And through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned    His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass      Across the mirror, and a little hand    Stole into his, and warm lips timidly    Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh.     Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,      And ever nigher still their faces came,    And nigher ever did their young mouths draw      Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,    And longing arms around her neck he cast,    And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,     And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,      And all her maidenhood was his to slay,    And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss      Their passion waxed and waned,--O why essay    To pipe again of love too venturous reed!    Enough, enough that Er\u00f4s laughed upon that flowerless mead.     Too venturous poesy O why essay      To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings    O'er daring Icarus and bid thy lay      Sleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings,    Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,    Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quill!     Enough, enough that he whose life had been      A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,    Could in the loveless land of Hades glean      One scorching harvest from those fields of flame    Where passion walks with naked unshod feet    And is not wounded,--ah! enough that once their lips could meet      In that wild throb when all existences      Seem narrowed to one single ecstasy    Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress      Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone    Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne    Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone. \r\n                         \n", "Helas!": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        To drift with every passion till my soul  Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play,  Is it for this that I have given away  Mine ancient wisdom, and austere control?-  Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll  Scrawled over on some boyish holiday  With idle songs for pipe and virelay  Which do but mar the secret of the whole.  Surely that was a time I might have trod  The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance  Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God;  is that time dead? lo! with a little rod  I did but touch the honey of romance-  And must I lose a soul's inheritance? \r\n                         \n", "Panthea": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                           NAY, let us walk from fire unto fire,      From passionate pain to deadlier delight,--    I am too young to live without desire,      Too young art thou to waste this summer night    Asking those idle questions which of old    Man sought of seer and oracle, and no reply was told.     For, sweet, to feel is better than to know,      And wisdom is a childless heritage,    One pulse of passion--youth's first fiery glow,--      Are worth the hoarded proverbs of the sage:    Vex not thy soul with dead philosophy,    Have we not lips to kiss with, hearts to love, and eyes to see!     Dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale      Like water bubbling from a silver jar,    So soft she sings the envious moon is pale,      That high in heaven she is hung so far    She cannot hear that love-enraptured tune,--    Mark how she wreathes each horn with mist, yon late and labouring          moon.     White lilies, in whose cups the gold bees dream,      The fallen snow of petals where the breeze    Scatters the chestnut blossom, or the gleam      Of boyish limbs in water,--are not these    Enough for thee, dost thou desire more?    Alas! the Gods will give nought else from their eternal store.     For our high Gods have sick and wearied grown      Of all our endless sins, our vain endeavour    For wasted days of youth to make atone      By pain or prayer or priest, and never, never,    Hearken they now to either good or ill,    But send their rain upon the just and the unjust at will.     They sit at ease, our Gods they sit at ease,      Strewing with leaves of rose their scented wine,    They sleep, they sleep, beneath the rocking trees      Where asphodel and yellow lotus twine,    Mourning the old glad days before they knew    What evil things the heart of man could dream, and dreaming do.     And far beneath the brazen floor they see      Like swarming flies the crowd of little men,    The bustle of small lives, then wearily      Back to their lotus-haunts they turn again    Kissing each other's mouths, and mix more deep    The poppy-seeded draught which brings soft purple-lidded sleep.     There all day long the golden-vestured sun,      Their torch-bearer, stands with his torch a-blaze,    And when the gaudy web of noon is spun      By its twelve maidens through the crimson haze    Fresh from Endymion's arms comes forth the moon,    And the immortal Gods in toils of mortal passions swoon.     There walks Queen Juno through some dewy mead      Her grand white feet flecked with the saffron dust    Of wind-stirred lilies, while young Ganymede      Leaps in the hot and amber-foaming must,    His curls all tossed, as when the eagle bare    The frightened boy from Ida through the blue Ionian air.     There in the green heart of some garden close      Queen Venus with the shepherd at her side,    Her warm soft body like the briar rose      Which would be white yet blushes at its pride,    Laughs low for love, till jealous Salmacis    Peers through the myrtle-leaves and sighs for pain of lonely          bliss.     There never does that dreary north-wind blow      Which leaves our English forests bleak and bare,    Nor ever falls the swift white-feathered snow,      Nor doth the red-toothed lightning ever dare    To wake them in the silver-fretted night    When we lie weeping for some sweet sad sin, some dead delight.     Alas! they know the far Leth\u00e6an spring,      The violet-hidden waters well they know,    Where one whose feet with tired wandering      Are faint and broken may take heart and go,    And from those dark depths cool and crystalline    Drink, and draw balm, and sleep for sleepless souls, and anodyne.     But we oppress our natures, God or Fate      Is our enemy, we starve and feed    On vain repentance--O we are born too late!      What balm for us in bruis\u00e8d poppy seed    Who crowd into one finite pulse of time    The joy of infinite love and the fierce pain of infinite crime.     O we are wearied of this sense of guilt,      Wearied of pleasure's paramour despair,    Wearied of every temple we have built,      Wearied of every right, unanswered prayer,    For man is weak; God sleeps: and heaven is high:    One fiery-coloured moment: one great love; and lo! we die.     Ah! but no ferry-man with labouring pole      Nears his black shallop to the flowerless strand,    No little coin of bronze can bring the soul      Over Death's river to the sunless land,    Victim and wine and vow are all in vain,    The tomb is sealed; the soldiers watch; the dead rise not again.     We are resolved into the supreme air,      We are made one with what we touch and see,    With our heart's blood each crimson sun is fair,      With our young lives each spring-impassioned tree    Flames into green, the wildest beasts that range    The moor our kinsmen are, all life is one, and all is change.     With beat of systole and of diastole      One grand great life throbs through earth's giant heart,    And mighty waves of single Being roll      From nerve-less germ to man, for we are part    Of every rock and bird and beast and hill,    One with the things that prey on us, and one with what we kill.     From lower cells of waking life we pass      To full perfection; thus the world grows old:    We who are godlike now were once a mass      Of quivering purple flecked with bars of gold,    Unsentient or of joy or misery,    And tossed in terrible tangles of some wild and wind-swept sea.     This hot hard flame with which our bodies burn      Will make some meadow blaze with daffodil,    Ay! and those argent breasts of thine will turn      To water-lilies; the brown fields men till    Will be more fruitful for our love to-night,    Nothing is lost in nature, all things live in Death's despite.     The boy's first kiss, the hyacinth's first bell,      The man's last passion, and the last red spear    That from the lily leaps, the asphodel      Which will not let its blossoms blow for fear    Of too much beauty, and the timid shame    Of the young bride-groom at his lover's eyes,--these with the          same     One sacrament are consecrate, the earth      Not we alone hath passions hymeneal,    The yellow buttercups that shake for mirth      At daybreak know a pleasure not less real    Than we do, when in some fresh-blossoming wood    We draw the spring into our hearts, and feel that life is good.     So when men bury us beneath the yew      Thy crimson-stain\u00e8d mouth a rose will be,    And thy soft eyes lush bluebells dimmed with dew,      And when the white narcissus wantonly    Kisses the wind its playmate, some faint joy    Will thrill our dust, and we will be again fond maid and boy.     And thus without life's conscious torturing pain      In some sweet flower we will feel the sun,    And from the linnet's throat will sing again,      And as two gorgeous-mail\u00e8d snakes will run    Over our graves, or as two tigers creep    Through the hot jungle where the yellow-eyed huge lions sleep     And give them battle! How my heart leaps up      To think of that grand living after death    In beast and bird and flower, when this cup,      Being filled too full of spirit, bursts for breath,    And with the pale leaves of some autumn day    The soul earth's earliest conqueror becomes earth's last great prey.     O think of it! We shall inform ourselves      Into all sensuous life, the goat-foot Faun,    The Centaur, or the merry bright-eyed Elves      That leave their dancing rings to spite the dawn    Upon the meadows, shall not be more near    Than you and I to nature's mysteries, for we shall hear     The thrush's heart beat, and the daisies grow,      And the wan snowdrop sighing for the sun    On sunless days in winter, we shall know      By whom the silver gossamer is spun,    Who paints the diapered fritillaries,    On what wide wings from shivering pine to pine the eagle flies.     Ay! had we never loved at all, who knows      If yonder daffodil had lured the bee    Into its gilded womb, or any rose      Had hung with crimson lamps its little tree!    Methinks no leaf would ever bud in spring,    But for the lovers' lips that kiss, the poets' lips that sing.     Is the light vanished from our golden sun,      Or is this d\u00e6dal-fashioned earth less fair,    That we are nature's heritors, and one      With every pulse of life that beats the air?    Rather new suns across the sky shall pass,    New splendour come unto the flower, new glory to the grass.     And we two lovers shall not sit afar,      Critics of nature, but the joyous sea    Shall be our raiment, and the bearded star      Shoot arrows at our pleasure! We shall be    Part of the mighty universal whole,    And through all \u00e6ons mix and mingle with the Kosmic Soul!     We shall be notes in that great Symphony      Whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres,    And all the live World's throbbing heart shall be      One with our heart, the stealthy creeping years    Have lost their terrors now, we shall not die,    The Universe itself shall be our Immortality! \r\n                         \n", "Ballade De Marguerite": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        (NORMANDE.)

But when they had unloosed the linen band  Which swathed the Egyptian's body,- lo! was found  Closed in the wasted hollow of her hand  A little seed, which sown in English ground  Did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear,  And spread rich odors through our springtide air.  With such strange arts this flower did allure  That all forgotten was the asphodel,  And the brown bee, the lily's paramour,  Forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell,  For not a thing of earth it seemed to be,  But stolen from some heavenly Arcady.  In vain the sad narcissus, wan and white  At its own beauty, hung across the stream,  The purple dragon-fly had no delight  With its gold-dust to make his wings a-gleam,  Ah! no delight the jasmine-bloom to kiss,  Or brush the rain-pearls from the eucharis.  For love of it the passionate nightingale  Forgot the hills of Thrace, the cruel king,  And the pale dove no longer cared to sail  Through the wet woods at time of blossoming,  But round this flower of Egypt sought to float,  With silvered wing and amethystine throat.  While the hot sun blazed in his tower of blue  A cooling wind crept from the land of snows,  And the warm south with tender tears of dew  Drenched its white leaves when Hesperos uprose  Amid those sea-green meadows of the sky  On which the scarlet bars of sunset lie.  But when o'er wastes of lily-haunted field  The tired birds had stayed their amorous tune,  And broad and glittering like an argent shield  High in the sapphire heavens hung the moon,  Did no strange dream or evil memory make  Each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake?   Ah no! to this bright flower a thousand years  Seemed but the lingering of a summer's day,  It never knew the tide of cankering fears  Which turn a boy's gold hair to withered gray,  The dread desire of death it never knew,  Or how all folk that they were born must rue.

The poor called to thee and thou didst not hearken, and thine ears were closed to the cry of My afflicted. The inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto thyself, and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy neighbour's field. Thou didst take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs to eat, and My lepers who lived in the marshes, and were at peace and praised Me, thou didst drive forth on to the highways, and on Mine earth out of which I made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.'

Thou didst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them. With antimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear with myrrh. Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them, and the thrones of thine idols were set in the sun. Thou didst show to the sun thy shame and to the moon thy madness.'

The blue-green beanfields yonder, tremulous      With the last shower, sweeter perfume bring    Through this cool evening than the odorous      Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing,    When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine,    And makes God's body from the common fruit of corn and vine.     Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the mass      Were out of tune now, for a small brown bird    Sings overhead, and through the long cool grass      I see that throbbing throat which once I heard    On starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady,    Once where the white and crescent sand of Salamis meets sea.     Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves      At daybreak, when the mower whets his scythe,    And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves      Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe    To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait    Stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate.     And sweet the hops upon the Kentish leas,      And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,    And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees      That round and round the linden blossoms play;    And sweet the heifer breathing in the stall,    And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick wall.     And sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring      While the last violet loiters by the well,    And sweet to hear the shepherd Daphnis sing      The song of Linus through a sunny dell    Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold    And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled fold.     And sweet with young Lycoris to recline      In some Illyrian valley far away,    Where canopied on herbs amaracine      We too might waste the summer-tranc\u00e8d day    Matching our reeds in sportive rivalry,    While far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea.     But sweeter far if silver-sandalled foot      Of some long-hidden God should ever tread    The Nuneham meadows, if with reeded flute      Pressed to his lips some Faun might raise his head    By the green water-flags, ah! sweet indeed    To see the heavenly herdsman call his white-fleeced flock to feed.     Then sing to me thou tuneful chorister,      Though what thou sing'st be thine own requiem!    Tell me thy tale thou hapless chronicler      Of thine own tragedies! do not contemn    These unfamiliar haunts, this English field,    For many a lovely coronal our northern isle can yield,     Which Grecian meadows know not, many a rose,      Which all day long in vales \u00c6olian    A lad might seek in vain for, overgrows      Our hedges like a wanton courtezan    Unthrifty of her beauty, lilies too    Ilissus never mirrored star our streams, and cockles blue     Dot the green wheat which, though they are the signs      For swallows going south, would never spread    Their azure tents between the Attic vines;      Even that little weed of ragged red,    Which bids the robin pipe, in Arcady    Would be a trespasser, and many an unsung elegy     Sleeps in the reeds that fringe our winding Thames      Which to awake were sweeter ravishment    Than ever Syrinx wept for, diadems      Of brown bee-studded orchids which were meant    For Cyther\u00e6a's brows are hidden here    Unknown to Cyther\u00e6a, and by yonder pasturing steer     There is a tiny yellow daffodil,      The butterfly can see it from afar,    Although one summer evening's dew could fill      Its little cup twice over ere the star    Had called the lazy shepherd to his fold    And be no prodigal, each leaf is flecked with spotted gold     As if Jove's gorgeous leman Dana\u00e9      Hot from his gilded arms had stooped to kiss    The trembling petals, or young Mercury      Low-flying to the dusky ford of Dis    Had with one feather of his pinions    Just brushed them!--the slight stem which bears the burden of its         suns     Is hardly thicker than the gossamer,      Or poor Arachne's silver tapestry,--    Men say it bloomed upon the sepulchre      Of One I sometime worshipped, but to me    It seems to bring diviner memories    Of faun-loved Heliconian glades and blue nymph-haunted seas,     Of an untrodden vale at Tempe where      On the clear river's marge Narcissus lies,    The tangle of the forest in his hair,      The silence of the woodland in his eyes,    Wooing that drifting imagery which is    No sooner kissed than broken, memories of Salmacis     Who is not boy or girl and yet is both,      Fed by two fires and unsatisfied    Through their excess, each passion being loth      For love's own sake to leave the other's side    Yet killing love by staying, memories    Of Oreads peeping through the leaves of silent moon-lit trees,     Of lonely Ariadne on the wharf      At Naxos, when she saw the treacherous crew    Far out at sea, and waved her crimson scarf      And called false Theseus back again nor knew    That Dionysos on an amber pard    Was close behind her, memories of what Maeonia's bard     With sightless eyes beheld, the wall of Troy,      Queen Helen lying in the carven room,    And at her side an amorous red-lipped boy      Trimming with dainty hand his helmet's plume,    And far away the moil, the shout, the groan,    As Hector shielded off the spear and Ajax hurled the stone;     Of wing\u00e8d Perseus with his flawless sword      Cleaving the snaky tresses of the witch,    And all those tales imperishably stored      In little Grecian urns, freightage more rich    Than any gaudy galleon of Spain    Bare from the Indies ever! these at least bring back again,     For well I know they are not dead at all,      The ancient Gods of Grecian poesy,    They are asleep, and when they hear thee call      Will wake and think 't is very Thessaly,    This Thames the Daulian waters, this cool glade    The yellow-irised mead where once young Itys laughed and played.     If it was thou dear jasmine-cradled bird      Who from the leafy stillness of thy throne    Sang to the wondrous boy, until he heard      The horn of Atalanta faintly blown    Across the Cumner hills, and wandering    Through Bagley wood at evening found the Attic poets' spring,--     Ah! tiny sober-suited advocate      That pleadest for the moon against the day!    If thou didst make the shepherd seek his mate      On that sweet questing, when Proserpina    Forgot it was not Sicily and leant    Across the mossy Sandford stile in ravished wonderment,--     Light-winged and bright-eyed miracle of the wood!      If ever thou didst soothe with melody    One of that little clan, that brotherhood      Which loved the morning-star of Tuscany    More than the perfect sun of Raphael    And is immortal, sing to me! for I too love thee well,     Sing on! sing on! let the dull world grow young,      Let elemental things take form again,    And the old shapes of Beauty walk among      The simple garths and open crofts, as when    The son of Leto bare the willow rod,    And the soft sheep and shaggy goats followed the boyish God.     Sing on! sing on! and Bacchus will be here      Astride upon his gorgeous Indian throne,    And over whimpering tigers shake the spear      With yellow ivy crowned and gummy cone,    While at his side the wanton Bassarid    Will throw the lion by the mane and catch the mountain kid!     Sing on! and I will wear the leopard skin,      And steal the moon\u00e9d wings of Ashtaroth,    Upon whose icy chariot we could win      Cith\u00e6ron in an hour e'er the froth    Has overbrimmed the wine-vat or the Faun    Ceased from the treading! ay, before the flickering lamp of dawn     Has scared the hooting owlet to its nest,      And warned the bat to close its filmy vans,    Some M\u00e6nad girl with vine-leaves on her breast      Will filch their beechnuts from the sleeping Pans    So softly that the little nested thrush    Will never wake, and then with shrilly laugh and leap will rush     Down the green valley where the fallen dew       Lies thick beneath the elm and count her store,    Till the brown Satyrs in a jolly crew       Trample the loosestrife down along the shore,    And where their horn\u00e8d master sits in state    Bring strawberries and bloomy plums upon a wicker crate!     Sing on! and soon with passion-wearied face       Through the cool leaves Apollo's lad will come,    The Tyrian prince his bristled boar will chase       Adown the chestnut-copses all a-bloom,    And ivory-limbed, grey-eyed, with look of pride,    After yon velvet-coated deer the virgin maid will ride.     Sing on! and I the dying boy will see       Stain with his purple blood the waxen bell    That overweighs the jacinth, and to me       The wretched Cyprian her woe will tell,    And I will kiss her mouth and streaming eyes,    And lead her to the myrtle-hidden grove where Adon lies!     Cry out aloud on Itys! memory      That foster-brother of remorse and pain    Drops poison in mine ear,--O to be free,      To burn one's old ships! and to launch again    Into the white-plumed battle of the waves    And fight old Proteus for the spoil of coral-flowered caves!     O for Medea with her poppied spell!      O for the secret of the Colchian shrine!    O for one leaf of that pale asphodel      Which binds the tired brows of Proserpine,    And sheds such wondrous dews at eve that she    Dreams of the fields of Enna, by the far Sicilian sea,     Where oft the golden-girdled bee she chased      From lily to lily on the level mead,    Ere yet her sombre Lord had bid her taste      The deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed,    Ere the black steeds had harried her away    Down to the faint and flowerless land, the sick and sunless day.     O for one midnight and as paramour      The Venus of the little Melian farm!    O that some antique statue for one hour      Might wake to passion, and that I could charm    The Dawn at Florence from its dumb despair    Mix with those mighty limbs and make that giant breast my lair!     Sing on! sing on! I would be drunk with life,      Drunk with the trampled vintage of my youth,    I would forget the wearying wasted strife,      The riven vale, the Gorgon eyes of Truth,    The prayerless vigil and the cry for prayer,    The barren gifts, the lifted arms, the dull insensate air!     Sing on! sing on! O feathered Niobe,      Thou canst make sorrow beautiful, and steal    From joy its sweetest music, not as we      Who by dead voiceless silence strive to heal    Our too untented wounds, and do but keep    Pain barricadoed in our hearts, and murder pillowed sleep.     Sing louder yet, why must I still behold      The wan white face of that deserted Christ,    Whose bleeding hands my hands did once enfold,      Whose smitten lips my lips so oft have kissed,    And now in mute and marble misery    Sits in his lone dishonoured House and weeps, perchance for me.     O memory cast down thy wreath\u00e8d shell!      Break thy hoarse lute O sad Melpomene!    O sorrow sorrow keep thy cloistered cell      Nor dim with tears this limpid Castaly!    Cease, cease, sad bird, thou dost the forest wrong    To vex its sylvan quiet with such wild impassioned song!     Cease, cease, or if 'tis anguish to be dumb      Take from the pastoral thrush her simpler air,    Whose jocund carelessness doth more become      This English woodland than thy keen despair,    Ah! cease and let the northwind bear thy lay    Back to the rocky hills of Thrace, the stormy Daulian bay.     A moment more, the startled leaves had stirred,      Endymion would have passed across the mead    Moonstruck with love, and this still Thames had heard      Pan plash and paddle groping for some reed    To lure from her blue cave that Naiad maid    Who for such piping listens half in joy and half afraid.     A moment more, the waking dove had cooed,      The silver daughter of the silver sea    With the fond gyves of clinging hands had wooed      Her wanton from the chase, and Dryope    Had thrust aside the branches of her oak    To see the lusty gold-haired lad rein in his snorting yoke.     A moment more, the trees had stooped to kiss      Pale Daphne just awakening from the swoon    Of tremulous laurels, lonely Salmacis      Had bared his barren beauty to the moon,    And through the vale with sad voluptuous smile    Antinous had wandered, the red lotus of the Nile     Down leaning from his black and clustering hair      To shade those slumberous eyelids' caverned bliss,    Or else on yonder grassy slope with bare      High-tuniced limbs unravished Artemis    Had bade her hounds give tongue, and roused the deer    From his green ambuscade with shrill halloo and pricking spear.     Lie still, lie still, O passionate heart, lie still!      O Melancholy, fold thy raven wing!    O sobbing Dryad, from thy hollow hill      Come not with such desponded answering!    No more thou wing\u00e8d Marsyas complain,    Apollo loveth not to hear such troubled songs of pain!     It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,      No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,    The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,      And from the copse left desolate and bare    Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,    Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody     So sad, that one might think a human heart      Brake in each separate note, a quality    Which music sometimes has, being the Art      Which is most nigh to tears and memory,    Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?    Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,     Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,      No woven web of bloody heraldries,    But mossy dells for roving comrades made,      Warm valleys where the tired student lies    With half-shut book, and many a winding walk    Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.     The harmless rabbit gambols with its young      Across the trampled towing-path, where late    A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng      Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;    The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,    Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds     Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out      Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock    Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout      Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,    And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,    And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill.     The heron passes homeward to the mere,      The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,    Gold world by world the silent stars appear,      And like a blossom blown before the breeze,    A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,    Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody.     She does not heed thee, wherefore should she heed,      She knows Endymion is not far away,    'Tis I, 'tis I, whose soul is as the reed      Which has no message of its own to play,    So pipes another's bidding, it is I,    Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.     Ah! the brown bird has ceased: one exquisite trill      About the sombre woodland seems to cling,    Dying in music, else the air is still,      So still that one might hear the bat's small wing    Wander and wheel above the pines, or tell    Each tiny dewdrop dripping from the blue-bell's brimming cell.     And far away across the lengthening wold,      Across the willowy flats and thickets brown,    Magdalen's tall tower tipped with tremulous gold      Marks the long High Street of the little town,    And warns me to return; I must not wait,    Hark! 'tis the curfew booming from the bell at Christ Church gate. \r\n                         \n", "To Milton": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                                  MILTON! I think thy spirit hath passed away             From these white cliffs, and high-embattled towers;             This gorgeous fiery-coloured world of ours           Seems fallen into ashes dull and grey,           And the age changed unto a mimic play             Wherein we waste our else too-crowded hours:             For all our pomp and pageantry and powers           We are but fit to delve the common clay,           Seeing this little isle on which we stand,             This England, this sea-lion of the sea,             By ignorant demagogues is held in fee,           Who love her not: Dear God! is this the land             Which bare a triple empire in her hand             When Cromwell spake the word Democracy! \r\n                         \n"}
