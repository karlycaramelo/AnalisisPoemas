{"The Highland Broach": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        If to Tradition faith be due,  And echoes from old verse speak true, Ere the meek Saint, Columba, bore Glad tidings to Iona's shore, No common light of nature blessed The mountain region of the west, A land where gentle manners ruled O'er men in dauntless virtues schooled, That raised, for centuries, a bar Impervious to the tide of war;  Yet peaceful Arts did entrance gain Where haughty Force had striven in vain, And, 'mid the works of skilful hands, By wanderers brought from foreign lands And various climes, was not unknown The clasp that fixed the Roman Gown;  The Fibula, whose shape, I ween, Still in the Highland Broach is seen, Worn at the breast of some grave Dame On road or path, or at the door Of fern-thatched Hut on heathy moor: But delicate of yore its mould, And the material finest gold; As might beseem the fairest Fair, Whether she graced a royal chair,  Or shed, within a vaulted Hall, No fancied lustre on the wall Where shields of mighty Heroes hung, While Fingal heard what Ossian sung.  The heroic Age expired - it slept Deep in its tomb: - the bramble crept O'er Fingal's hearth; the grassy sod Grew on the floors his Sons had trod; Malvina! where art thou? Their state The noblest-born must abdicate, The fairest, while with fire and sword Come Spoilers - horde impelling horde, Must walk the sorrowing mountains, drest By ruder hands in homelier vest, Yet still the female bosom lent, And loved to borrow, ornament; Still was its inner world a place Reached by the dews of heavenly grace; Still pity to this last retreat Clove fondly; to his favourite seat Love wound his way by soft approach, Beneath a massier Highland Broach.  When alternations came of rage Yet fiercer, in a darker age; And feuds, where, clan encountering clan, The weaker perished to a man; For maid and mother, when despair Might else have triumphed, baffling prayer, One small  possession lacked not power, Provided in a calmer hour, To meet such need as might befall - Roof, raiment, bread, or burial: For woman, even of tears bereft, The hidden silver Broach was left.  As generations come and go, Their arts, their customs, ebb and flow; Fate, fortune, sweep strong powers away, And feeble, of themselves, decay; What poor abodes their heir-loom hide, In which the castle once took pride! Tokens, once kept as boasted wealth, If saved at all, are saved by stealth. Lo! ships, from seas by nature barred, Mount along ways by man prepared; And in far-stretching vales, whose streams Seek other seas, their canvas gleams. Lo! busy towns spring up, on coasts Thronged yesterday by airy ghosts; Soon, like a lingering star forlorn Among the novelties of morn, While young delights on old encroach, Will vanish the last Highland Broach.  But when, from out their viewless bed, Like vapours, years have rolled and spread And this poor verse, and worthier lays, Shall yield no light of love or praise, Then, by the spade, or cleaving plough, Or torrent from the mountain's brow. Or whirlwind, reckless what his might Entombs, or forces into light, Blind Chance, a volunteer ally, That oft befriends Antiquity, And clears Oblivion from reproach, May render back the Highland Broach. \r\n                         \n", "Upon Perusing The Forgoing Epistle Thirty Years After Its Composition": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        SOON did he Almighty Giver of all rest Take those dear young Ones to a fearless nest; And in Death's arms has long reposed the Friend For whom this simple Register was penned.

And therewithal to cover his intent A cause he found into the Town to go, And they right forth to Cresid's Palace went;  But, Lord, this simple Troilus was woe, Him thought his sorrowful heart would break in two; For when he saw her doors fast bolted all, Well nigh for sorrow down he 'gan to fall.  Therewith when this true Lover 'gan behold, How shut was every window of the place, Like frost he thought his heart was icy cold; For which, with changed, pale, and deadly face, Without word uttered, forth he 'gan to pace; And on his purpose bent so fast to ride,  That no wight his continuance espied.  Then said he thus,--O Palace desolate! O house of houses, once so richly dight! O Palace empty and disconsolate! Thou lamp of which extinguished is the light; O Palace whilom day that now art night, Thou ought'st to fall and I to die; since she Is gone who held us both in sovereignty.  O, of all houses once the crowned boast! Palace illumined with the sun of bliss;  O ring of which the ruby now is lost, O cause of woe, that cause has been of bliss: Yet, since I may no better, would I kiss Thy cold doors; but I dare not for this rout; Farewell, thou shrine of which the Saint is out.  Therewith he cast on Pandarus an eye, With changed face, and piteous to behold; And when he might his time aright espy, Aye as he rode, to Pandarus he told Both his new sorrow and his joys of old,  So piteously, and with so dead a hue, That every wight might on his sorrow rue.  Forth from the spot he rideth up and down, And everything to his rememberance Came as he rode by places of the town Where he had felt such perfect pleasure once. Lo, yonder saw I mine own Lady dance, And in that Temple she with her bright eyes, My Lady dear, first bound me captive-wise.  And yonder with joy-smitten heart have I  Heard my own Cresid's laugh; and once at play I yonder saw her eke full blissfully; And yonder once she unto me 'gan say-- Now, my sweet Troilus, love me well, I pray! And there so graciously did me behold, That hers unto the death my heart I hold.  And at the corner of that self-same house Heard I my most beloved Lady dear, So womanly, with voice melodious Singing so well, so goodly, and so clear,  That in my soul methinks I yet do hear The blissful sound; and in that very place My Lady first me took unto her grace.  O blissful God of Love! then thus he cried, When I the process have in memory, How thou hast wearied me on every side, Men thence a book might make, a history;  What need to seek a conquest over me,  Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy  Hast thou thy own liege subjects to destroy?   Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ire Well hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief. Now mercy, Lord! thou know'st well I desire Thy grace above all pleasures first and chief; And live and die I will in thy belief; For which I ask for guerdon but one boon, That Cresida again thou send me soon.  Constrain her heart as quickly to return, As thou dost mine with longing her to see, Then know I well that she would not sojourn.  Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not be Unto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee, As Juno was unto the Theban blood, From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.  And after this he to the gate did go, Whence Cresid rode, as if in haste she was; And up and down there went, and to and fro, And to himself full oft he said, alas! From hence my hope, and solace forth did pass. O would the blissful God now for his joy,  I might her see again coming to Troy!  And up to yonder hill was I her guide; Alas, and there I took of her my leave; Yonder I saw her to her Father ride, For very grief of which my heart shall cleave;-- And hither home I came when it was eve; And here I dwell an outcast from all joy, And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy.  And of himself did he imagine oft, That he was blighted, pale, and waxen less  Than he was wont; and that in whispers soft Men said, what may it be, can no one guess Why Troilus hath all this heaviness? All which he of himself conceited wholly Out of his weakness and his melancholy.  Another time he took into his head, That every wight, who in the way passed by, Had of him ruth, and fancied that they said, I am right sorry Troilus will die: And thus a day or two drove wearily;  As ye have heard; such life 'gan he to lead As one that standeth betwixt hope and dread.  For which it pleased him in his songs to show The occasion of his woe, as best he might; And made a fitting song, of words but few, Somewhat his woeful heart to make more light; And when he was removed from all men's sight, With a soft night voice, he of his Lady dear, That absent was, 'gan sing as ye may hear.  O star, of which I lost have all the light,  With a sore heart well ought I to bewail, That ever dark in torment, night by night, Toward my death with wind I steer and sail; For which upon the tenth night if thou fail With thy bright beams to guide me but one hour, My ship and me Charybdis will devour.  As soon as he this song had thus sung through, He fell again into his sorrows old; And every night, as was his wont to do, Troilus stood the bright moon to behold;  And all his trouble to the moon he told, And said; I wis, when thou art horn'd anew, I shall be glad if all the world be true.  Thy horns were old as now upon that morrow, When hence did journey my bright Lady dear, That cause is of my torment and my sorrow; For which, oh, gentle Luna, bright and clear; For love of God, run fast above thy sphere; For when thy horns begin once more to spring, Then shall she come, that with her bliss may bring.   The day is more, and longer every night Than they were wont to be---for he thought so; And that the sun did take his course not right, By longer way than he was wont to go; And said, I am in constant dread I trow, That Phaeton his son is yet alive, His too fond father's car amiss to drive.  Upon the walls fast also would he walk, To the end that he the Grecian host might see; And ever thus he to himself would talk:--  Lo! yonder is my own bright Lady free; Or yonder is it that the tents must be; And thence does come this air which is so sweet, That in my soul I feel the joy of it.  And certainly this wind, that more and more By moments thus increaseth in my face, Is of my Lady's sighs heavy and sore; I prove it thus; for in no other space Of all this town, save only in this place, Feel I a wind, that soundeth so like pain;  It saith, Alas, why severed are we twain?  A weary while in pain he tosseth thus, Till fully past and gone was the ninth night; And ever at his side stood Pandarus, Who busily made use of all his might To comfort him, and make his heart more light; Giving him always hope, that she the morrow Of the tenth day will come, and end his sorrow. \r\n                         \n", "The French Army In Russia, 1812-13": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        HUMANITY, delighting to behold A fond reflection of her own decay, Hath painted Winter like a traveller old, Propped on a staff, and, through the sullen day, In hooded mantle, limping o'er the plain, As though his weakness were disturbed by pain: Or, if a juster fancy should allow An undisputed symbol of command, The chosen sceptre is a withered bough, Infirmly grasped within a palsied hand.

I sang-Let myriads of bright flowers,    Like Thee, in field and grove Revive unenvied;-mightier far,    Than tremblings that reprove Our vernal tendencies to hope,    Is God's redeeming love;  That love which changed-for wan disease,    For sorrow that had bent O'er hopeless dust, for withered age-    Their moral element, And turned the thistles of a curse    To types beneficent.  Sin-blighted though we are, we too,    The reasoning Sons of Men, From one oblivious winter called    Shall rise, and breathe again; And in eternal summer lose    Our threescore years and ten.  To humbleness of heart descends    This prescience from on high, The faith that elevates the just,    Before and when they die; And makes each soul a separate heaven    A court for Deity. \r\n                         \n", "The Power Of Armies Is A Visible Thing": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        The power of Armies is a visible thing,  Formal, and circumscribed in time and space;  But who the limits of that power shall trace  Which a brave People into light can bring  Or hide, at will,--for freedom combating  By just revenge inflamed? No foot may chase,  No eye can follow, to a fatal place  That power, that spirit, whether on the wing  Like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind  Within its awful caves.--From year to year  Springs this indigenous produce far and near;  No craft this subtle element can bind,  Rising like water from the soil, to find  In every nook a lip that it may cheer. \r\n                         \n", "When I Have Borne In Memory": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        WHEN I have borne in memory what has tamed Great Nations, how ennobling thoughts depart When men change swords for ledgers, and desert The student's bower for gold, some fears unnamed I had, my Country!--am I to be blamed? Now, when I think of thee, and what thou art, Verily, in the bottom of my heart, Of those unfilial fears I am ashamed. For dearly must we prize thee; we who find In thee a bulwark for the cause of men:  And I by my affection was beguiled: What wonder if a Poet now and then, Among the many movements of his mind, Felt for thee as a lover or a child! \r\n                         \n", "When To The Attractions Of The Busy World": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        WHEN, to the attractions of the busy world, Preferring studious leisure, I had chosen A habitation in this peaceful Vale, Sharp season followed of continual storm In deepest winter; and, from week to week, Pathway, and lane, and public road, were clogged With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill At a short distance from my cottage, stands A stately Fir-grove, whither I was wont To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof  Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place Of refuge, with an unincumbered floor. Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow, And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth, The redbreast near me hopped; nor was I loth To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds That, for protection from the nipping blast, Hither repaired.--A single beech-tree grew Within this grove of firs! and, on the fork Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest;  A last year's nest, conspicuously built At such small elevation from the ground As gave sure sign that they, who in that house Of nature and of love had made their home Amid the fir-trees, all the summer long Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes, A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock, Would watch my motions with suspicious stare, From the remotest outskirts of the grove,-- Some nook where they had made their final stand,  Huddling together from two fears--the fear Of me and of the storm. Full many an hour Here did I lose. But in this grove the trees Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven In such perplexed and intricate array; That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems A length of open space, where to and fro My feet might move without concern or care; And, baffled thus, though earth from day to day Was fettered, and the air by storm disturbed,  I ceased the shelter to frequent,--and prized, Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess. The snows dissolved, and genial Spring returned To clothe the fields with verdure. Other haunts Meanwhile were mine; till, one bright April day, By chance retiring from the glare of noon To this forsaken covert, there I found A hoary pathway traced between the trees, And winding on with such an easy line Along a natural opening, that I stood  Much wondering how I could have sought in vain For what was now so obvious. To abide, For an allotted interval of ease, Under my cottage-roof, had gladly come From the wild sea a cherished Visitant; And with the sight of this same path--begun, Begun and ended, in the shady grove, Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mind That, to this opportune recess allured, He had surveyed it with a finer eye,  A heart more wakeful; and had worn the track By pacing here, unwearied and alone, In that habitual restlessness of foot That haunts the Sailor measuring o'er and o'er His short domain upon the vessel's deck, While she pursues her course through the dreary sea. When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite's pleasant shore, And taken thy first leave of those green hills And rocks that were the play-ground of thy youth, Year followed year, my Brother! and we two,  Conversing not, knew little in what mould Each other's mind was fashioned; and at length, When once again we met in Grasmere Vale, Between us there was little other bond Than common feelings of fraternal love. But thou, a Schoolboy, to the sea hadst carried Undying recollections! Nature there Was with thee; she, who loved us both, she still Was with thee; and even so didst thou become A 'silent' Poet; from the solitude  Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heart Still couchant, an inevitable ear, And an eye practised like a blind man's touch. --Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone; Nor from this vestige of thy musing hours Could I withhold thy honoured name,--and now I love the fir-grove with a perfect love. Thither do I withdraw when cloudless suns Shine hot, or wind blows troublesome and strong; And there I sit at evening, when the steep  Of Silver-how, and Grasmere's peaceful lake, And one green island, gleam between the stems Of the dark firs, a visionary scene! And, while I gaze upon the spectacle Of clouded splendour, on this dream-like sight Of solemn loveliness, I think on thee, My Brother, and on all which thou hast lost. Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou, Muttering the verses which I muttered first Among the mountains, through the midnight watch  Art pacing thoughtfully the vessel's deck In some far region, here, while o'er my head, At every impulse of the moving breeze, The fir-grove murmurs with a sea-like sound, Alone I tread this path;--for aught I know, Timing my steps to thine; and, with a store Of undistinguishable sympathies, Mingling most earnest wishes for the day When we, and others whom we love, shall meet A second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale. \r\n                         \n", "Weak Is The Will Of Man, His Judgement Blind": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        'WEAK is the will of Man, his judgment blind; 'Remembrance persecutes, and Hope betrays; 'Heavy is woe;--and joy, for human-kind, 'A mournful thing, so transient is the blaze!'

Poised like a weary cloud, in middle air He hung,--then floated with angelic ease (Softening that bright effulgence by degrees) Till he had reached a summit sharp and bare, Where oft the venturous heifer drinks the noontide breeze. Upon the apex of that lofty cone Alighted, there the Stranger stood alone; Fair as a gorgeous Fabric of the east Suddenly raised by some enchanter's power, Where nothing was; and firm as some old Tower Of Britain's realm, whose leafy crest Waves high, embellished by a gleaming shower!  II  Beneath the shadow of his purple wings Rested a golden harp;--he touched the strings; And, after prelude of unearthly sound Poured through the echoing hills around, He sang-- 'No wintry desolations, Scorching blight or noxious dew, Affect my native habitations; Buried in glory, far beyond the scope Of man's inquiring gaze, but to his hope Imaged, though faintly, in the hue Profound of night's ethereal blue; And in the aspect of each radiant orb;-- Some fixed, some wandering with no timid curb: But wandering star and fixed, to mortal eye, Blended in absolute serenity, And free from semblance of decline;-- Fresh as if Evening brought their natal hour, Her darkness splendour gave, her silence power To testify of Love and Grace divine.  III  'What if those bright fires Shine subject to decay, Sons haply of extinguished sires, Themselves to lose their light, or pass away Like clouds before the wind, Be thanks poured out to Him whose hand bestows, Nightly, on human kind That vision of endurance and repose. --And though to every draught of vital breath Renewed throughout the bounds of earth or ocean, The melancholy gates of Death Respond with sympathetic motion; Though all that feeds on nether air, Howe'er magnificent or fair, Grows but to perish, and entrust Its ruins to their kindred dust; Yet, by the Almighty's ever-during care, Her procreant vigils Nature keeps Amid the unfathomable deeps; And saves the peopled fields of earth From dread of emptiness or dearth. Thus, in their stations, lifting tow'rd the sky The foliaged head in cloud-like majesty, The shadow-casting race of trees survive: Thus, in the train of Spring, arrive Sweet flowers;--what living eye hath viewed Their myriads?--endlessly renewed, Wherever strikes the sun's glad ray; Where'er the subtle waters stray; Wherever sportive breezes bend Their course, or genial showers descend! Mortals, rejoice! the very Angels quit Their mansions unsusceptible of change, Amid your pleasant bowers to sit, And through your sweet vicissitudes to range!'  IV  Oh, nursed at happy distance from the cares Of a too-anxious world, mild pastoral Muse! That, to the sparkling crown Urania wears, And to her sister Clio's laurel wreath, Prefer'st a garland culled from purple heath, Or blooming thicket moist with morning dews; Was such bright Spectacle vouchsafed to me? And was it granted to the simple ear Of thy contented Votary Such melody to hear! 'Him' rather suits it, side by side with thee, Wrapped in a fit of pleasing indolence, While thy tired lute hangs on the hawthorn-tree, To lie and listen--till o'er-drowsed sense Sinks, hardly conscious of the influence-- To the soft murmur of the vagrant Bee. --A slender sound! yet hoary Time Doth to the 'Soul' exalt it with the chime Of all his years;--a company Of ages coming, ages gone; (Nations from before them sweeping, Regions in destruction steeping,) But every awful note in unison With that faint utterance, which tells Of treasure sucked from buds and bells, For the pure keeping of those waxen cells; Where She--a statist prudent to confer Upon the common weal; a warrior bold, Radiant all over with unburnished gold, And armed with living spear for mortal fight; A cunning forager That spreads no waste; a social builder; one In whom all busy offices unite With all fine functions that afford delight-- Safe through the winter storm in quiet dwells!  V  And is She brought within the power Of vision?--o'er this tempting flower Hovering until the petals stay Her flight, and take its voice away!-- Observe each wing!--a tiny van!

Thy sting was needless then, perchance unknown, The seeds of malice were not sown; All creatures met in peace, from fierceness free, And no pride blended with their dignity. --Tears had not broken from their source; Nor Anguish strayed from her Tartarean den; The golden years maintained a course Not undiversified though smooth and even; We were not mocked with glimpse and shadow then, Bright Seraphs mixed familiarly with men; And earth and stars composed a universal heaven! \r\n                         \n", "To Dora": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        ''A little onward lend thy guiding hand To these dark steps, a little further on!'' --What trick of memory to 'my' voice hath brought This mournful iteration?

And yet more gladly thee would I conduct Through woods and spacious forests,--to behold There, how the Original of human art, Heaven-prompted Nature, measures and erects Her temples, fearless for the stately work, Though waves, to every breeze, its high-arched roof, And storms the pillars rock.

Now also shall the page of classic lore, To these glad eyes from bondage freed, again  Lie open; and the book of Holy Writ, Again unfolded, passage clear shall yield To heights more glorious still, and into shades More awful, where, advancing hand in hand, We may be taught, O Darling of my care!

To such inheritance of blessed fancy (Fancy that sports more desperately with minds Than ever fortune hath been known to do) The high-born Vaudracour was brought, by years Whose progress had a little overstepped His stripling prime. A town of small repute,  Among the vine-clad mountains of Auvergne, Was the Youth's birth-place. There he wooed a Maid Who heard the heart-felt music of his suit With answering vows. Plebeian was the stock, Plebeian, though ingenuous, the stock, From which her graces and her honours sprung: And hence the father of the enamoured Youth, With haughty indignation, spurned the thought Of such alliance.--From their cradles up, With but a step between their several homes,  Twins had they been in pleasure; after strife And petty quarrels, had grown fond again; Each other's advocate, each other's stay; And, in their happiest moments, not content, If more divided than a sportive pair Of sea-fowl, conscious both that they are hovering Within the eddy of a common blast, Or hidden only by the concave depth Of neighbouring billows from each other's sight. Thus, not without concurrence of an age  Unknown to memory, was an earnest given By ready nature for a life of love, For endless constancy, and placid truth; But whatsoe'er of such rare treasure lay Reserved, had fate permitted, for support Of their maturer years, his present mind Was under fascination;--he beheld A vision, and adored the thing he saw. Arabian fiction never filled the world With half the wonders that were wrought for him.  Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring; Life turned the meanest of her implements, Before his eyes, to price above all gold; The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine; Her chamber-window did surpass in glory The portals of the dawn; all paradise Could, by the simple opening of a door, Let itself in upon him:--pathways, walks, Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank, Surcharged, within him, overblest to move  Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world To its dull round of ordinary cares; A man too happy for mortality! So passed the time, till whether through effect Of some unguarded moment that dissolved Virtuous restraint--ah, speak it, think it, not! Deem rather that the fervent Youth, who saw So many bars between his present state And the dear haven where he wished to be In honourable wedlock with his Love,  Was in his judgment tempted to decline To perilous weakness, and entrust his cause To nature for a happy end of all; Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed, And bear with their transgression, when I add That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife, Carried about her for a secret grief The promise of a mother. To conceal The threatened shame, the parents of the Maid Found means to hurry her away by night,  And unforewarned, that in some distant spot She might remain shrouded in privacy, Until the babe was born. When morning came The Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss, And all uncertain whither he should turn, Chafed like a wild beast in the toils; but soon Discovering traces of the fugitives, Their steps he followed to the Maid's retreat. Easily may the sequel be divined-- Walks to and fro--watchings at every hour;  And the fair Captive, who, whene'er she may, Is busy at her casement as the swallow Fluttering its pinions, almost within reach, About the pendent nest, did thus espy Her Lover!--thence a stolen interview, Accomplished under friendly shade of night. I pass the raptures of the pair;--such theme Is, by innumerable poets, touched In more delightful verse than skill of mine Could fashion; chiefly by that darling bard  Who told of Juliet and her Romeo, And of the lark's note heard before its time, And of the streaks that laced the severing clouds In the unrelenting east.--Through all her courts The vacant city slept; the busy winds, That keep no certain intervals of rest, Moved not; meanwhile the galaxy displayed Her fires, that like mysterious pulses beat Aloft;--momentous but uneasy bliss! To their full hearts the universe seemed hung  On that brief meeting's slender filament! They parted; and the generous Vaudracour Reached speedily the native threshold, bent On making (so the Lovers had agreed) A sacrifice of birthright to attain A final portion from his father's hand; Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would flee To some remote and solitary place, Shady as night, and beautiful as heaven, Where they may live, with no one to behold  Their happiness, or to disturb their love. But 'now' of this no whisper; not the less, If ever an obtrusive word were dropped Touching the matter of his passion, still, In his stern father's hearing, Vaudracour Persisted openly that death alone Should abrogate his human privilege Divine, of swearing everlasting truth, Upon the altar, to the Maid he loved. 'You shall be baffled in your mad intent  If there be justice in the court of France,' Muttered the Father.--From these words the Youth Conceived a terror; and, by night or day, Stirred nowhere without weapons, that full soon Found dreadful provocation: for at night When to his chamber he retired, attempt Was made to seize him by three armed men, Acting, in furtherance of the father's will, Under a private signet of the State. One the rash Youth's ungovernable hand  Slew, and as quickly to a second gave A perilous wound--he shuddered to behold The breathless corse; then peacefully resigned His person to the law, was lodged in prison, And wore the fetters of a criminal. Have you observed a tuft of winged seed That, from the dandelion's naked stalk, Mounted aloft, is suffered not to use Its natural gifts for purposes of rest, Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro  Through the wide element? or have you marked The heavier substance of a leaf-clad bough, Within the vortex of a foaming flood, Tormented? by such aid you may conceive The perturbation that ensued;--ah, no! Desperate the Maid--the Youth is stained with blood; Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet! Yet as the troubled seed and tortured bough Is Man, subjected to despotic sway. For him, by private influence with the Court,  Was pardon gained, and liberty procured; But not without exaction of a pledge, Which liberty and love dispersed in air. He flew to her from whom they would divide him-- He clove to her who could not give him peace-- Yea, his first word of greeting was,--'All right Is gone from me; my lately-towering hopes, To the least fibre of their lowest root, Are withered; thou no longer canst be mine, I thine--the conscience-stricken must not woo  The unruffled Innocent,--I see thy face, Behold thee, and my misery is complete!' 'One, are we not?' exclaimed the Maiden--'One, For innocence and youth, for weal and woe?' Then with the father's name she coupled words Of vehement indignation; but the Youth Checked her with filial meekness; for no thought Uncharitable crossed his mind, no sense Of hasty anger rising in the eclipse Of true domestic loyalty, did e'er  Find place within his bosom.--Once again The persevering wedge of tyranny Achieved their separation: and once more Were they united,--to be yet again Disparted, pitiable lot! But here A portion of the tale may well be left In silence, though my memory could add Much how the Youth, in scanty space of time, Was traversed from without; much, too, of thoughts That occupied his days in solitude  Under privation and restraint; and what, Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come, And what, through strong compunction for the past, He suffered--breaking down in heart and mind! Doomed to a third and last captivity, His freedom he recovered on the eve Of Julia's travail. When the babe was born, Its presence tempted him to cherish schemes Of future happiness. 'You shall return, Julia,' said he, 'and to your father's house  Go with the child.--You have been wretched; yet The silver shower, whose reckless burthen weighs Too heavily upon the lily's head, Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root. Malice, beholding you, will melt away. Go!--'tis a town where both of us were born; None will reproach you, for our truth is known; And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fate Remain unpitied, pity is not in man. With ornaments--the prettiest, nature yields  Or art can fashion, shall you deck our boy, And feed his countenance with your own sweet looks Till no one can resist him.--Now, even now, I see him sporting on the sunny lawn; My father from the window sees him too; Startled, as if some new-created thing Enriched the earth, or Faery of the woods Bounded before him;--but the unweeting Child Shall by his beauty win his grandsire's heart So that it shall be softened, and our loves  End happily, as they began!' These gleams Appeared but seldom; oftener was he seen Propping a pale and melancholy face Upon the Mother's bosom; resting thus His head upon one breast, while from the other The Babe was drawing in its quiet food. --That pillow is no longer to be thine, Fond Youth! that mournful solace now must pass Into the list of things that cannot be! Unwedded Julia, terror-smitten, hears  The sentence, by her mother's lip pronounced, That dooms her to a convent.--Who shall tell, Who dares report, the tidings to the lord Of her affections? so they blindly asked Who knew not to what quiet depths a weight Of agony had pressed the Sufferer down: The word, by others dreaded, he can hear Composed and silent, without visible sign Of even the least emotion. Noting this, When the impatient object of his love  Upbraided him with slackness, he returned No answer, only took the mother's hand And kissed it; seemingly devoid of pain, Or care, that what so tenderly he pressed, Was a dependant on the obdurate heart Of one who came to disunite their lives For ever--sad alternative! preferred, By the unbending Parents of the Maid, To secret 'spousals meanly disavowed. --So be it! In the city he remained  A season after Julia had withdrawn To those religious walls. He, too, departs-- Who with him?--even the senseless Little-one. With that sole charge he passed the city-gates, For the last time, attendant by the side Of a close chair, a litter, or sedan, In which the Babe was carried. To a hill, That rose a brief league distant from the town, The dwellers in that house where he had lodged Accompanied his steps, by anxious love  Impelled;--they parted from him there, and stood Watching below till he had disappeared On the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took, Throughout that journey, from the vehicle (Slow-moving ark of all his hopes!) that veiled The tender infant: and, at every inn, And under every hospitable tree At which the bearers halted or reposed, Laid him with timid care upon his knees, And looked, as mothers ne'er were known to look,  Upon the nursling which his arms embraced. This was the manner in which Vaudracour Departed with his infant; and thus reached His father's house, where to the innocent child Admittance was denied. The young man spake No word of indignation or reproof, But of his father begged, a last request, That a retreat might be assigned to him Where in forgotten quiet he might dwell, With such allowance as his wants required;  For wishes he had none. To a lodge that stood Deep in a forest, with leave given, at the age Of four-and-twenty summers he withdrew; And thither took with him his motherless Babe, And one domestic for their common needs, An aged woman. It consoled him here To attend upon the orphan, and perform Obsequious service to the precious child, Which, after a short time, by some mistake Or indiscretion of the Father, died.--  The Tale I follow to its last recess Of suffering or of peace, I know not which: Theirs be the blame who caused the woe, not mine! From this time forth he never shared a smile With mortal creature. An Inhabitant Of that same town, in which the pair had left So lively a remembrance of their griefs, By chance of business, coming within reach Of his retirement, to the forest lodge Repaired, but only found the matron there,  Who told him that his pains were thrown away, For that her Master never uttered word To living thing--not even to her.--Behold! While they were speaking, Vaudracour approached; But, seeing some one near, as on the latch Of the garden-gate his hand was laid, he shrunk-- And, like a shadow, glided out of view. Shocked at his savage aspect, from the place The visitor retired. Thus lived the Youth Cut off from all intelligence with man,  And shunning even the light of common day; Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France Full speedily resounded, public hope, Or personal memory of his own deep wrongs, Rouse him: but in those solitary shades His days he wasted, an imbecile mind! \r\n                         \n", "To The Daisy (2)": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        BRIGHT Flower! whose home is everywhere, Bold in maternal Nature's care, And all the long year through the heir         Of joy or sorrow; Methinks that there abides in thee Some concord with humanity, Given to no other flower I see         The forest thorough!

The barrier Rhine hath flashed, through battle-smoke, On men who gaze heart-smitten by the view,  As if all Germany had felt the shock! --Fly, wretched Gauls! ere they the charge renew Who have seen--themselves now casting off the yoke-- The unconquerable Stream his course pursue. \r\n                         \n", "The French And The Spanish Guerillas": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        HUNGER, and sultry heat, and nipping blast From bleak hill-top, and length of march by night Through heavy swamp, or over snow-clad height-- These hardships ill-sustained, these dangers past, The roving Spanish Bands are reached at last, Charged, and dispersed like foam: but as a flight Of scattered quails by signs do reunite, So these,--and, heard of once again, are chased With combinations of long-practised art And newly-kindled hope; but they are fled--  Gone are they, viewless as the buried dead: Where now?--Their sword is at the Foeman's heart; And thus from year to year his walk they thwart, And hang like dreams around his guilty bed. \r\n                         \n", "To The Daisy (Fourth Poem)": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Sweet Flower! belike one day to have  A place upon thy Poet's grave,  I welcome thee once more:  But He, who was on land, at sea,  My Brother, too, in loving thee,  Although he loved more silently,  Sleeps by his native shore.   Ah! hopeful, hopeful was the day  When to that Ship he bent his way,  To govern and to guide:  His wish was gained: a little time  Would bring him back in manhood's prime  And free for life, these hills to climb;  With all his wants supplied.   And full of hope day followed day  While that stout Ship at anchor lay  Beside the shores of Wight;  The May had then made all things green;  And, floating there, in pomp serene,  That Ship was goodly to be seen,  His pride and his delight!   Yet then, when called ashore, he sought  The tender peace of rural thought:  In more than happy mood  To your abodes, bright daisy Flowers!  He then would steal at leisure hours,  And loved you glittering in your bowers  A starry multitude.   But hark the word!--the ship is gone;--  Returns from her long course:--anon  Sets sail:--in season due,  Once more on English earth they stand:  But, when a third time from the land  They parted, sorrow was at hand  For Him and for his crew.   Ill-fated Vessel!--ghastly shock!  --At length delivered from the rock,  The deep she hath regained;  And through the stormy night they steer;  Labouring for life, in hope and fear,  To reach a safer shore--how near,  Yet not to be attained!   \"Silence!\" the brave Commander cried:  To that calm word a shriek replied,  It was the last death-shriek.  --A few (my soul oft sees that sight)  Survive upon the tall mast's height;  But one dear remnant of the night--  For Him in vain I seek.   Six weeks beneath the moving sea  He lay in slumber quietly;  Unforced by wind or wave  To quit the Ship for which he died,  (All claims of duty satisfied;)  And there they found him at her side;  And bore him to the grave.   Vain service! yet not vainly done  For this, if other end were none,  That He, who had been cast  Upon a way of life unmeet  For such a gentle Soul and sweet,  Should find an undisturbed retreat  Near what he loved, at last--   That neighbourhood of grove and field  To Him a resting-place should yield,  A meek man and a brave!

Delicious odor! music sweet,      Too sweet to pass away! Oh for a deathless song to meet      The soul's desire---a lay That, when a thousand year are told,      Should praise thee, genial Power! Through summer heat, autumnal cold,      And winter's dreariest hour.  Earth, sea, thy presence feel---nor less,      If yon ethereal blue With its soft smile the truth express,      The heavens have felt it too. The inmost heart of man if glad      Partakes a livelier cheer; And eye that cannot but be sad      Let fall a brightened tear.

The Old, by thee revived, have said,      'Another year is ours;' And wayworn Wanderers, poorly fed,      Have smiled upon thy flowers.  Who tripping lisps a merry song      Amid his playful peers? The tender Infant who was long      A prisoner of fond fears; But now, when every sharp-edged blast      Is quiet in its sheath, His Mother leaves him free to taste      Earth's sweetness in thy breath.  Thy help is with the weed that creeps      Along the humblest ground; No cliff so bare but on its steeps      Thy favors may be found; But most on some peculiar nook      That our own hands have drest, Thou and thy train are proud to look,      And seem to love it best.  And yet how pleased we wander forth      When May is whispering, 'Come! 'Choose from the bowers of virgin earth      The happiest for your home; Heaven\u00d5s bounteous love through me is spread      From sunshine, clouds, winds, waves, Drops on the mouldering turret's head,      And on your turf-clad graves!'  Such greeting heard, away with sighs      For lilies that must fade, Or ' the rathe primrose as it dies      Forsaken' in the shade! Vernal fruitions and desires      Are linked in endless chase; While, as one kindly growth retires,      Another takes its place.  And what if thou, sweet May, hast known      Mishap by worm and blight; If expectations newly blown      Have perished in thy sight; If loves and joys, while up they sprung,      Were caught as in a snare; Such is the lot of all the young,      However bright and fair.

And lowly huts, near beaten ways,      No sooner stand attired In thy fresh wreaths, than they for praise      Peep forth, and are admired.  Season of fancy and of hope,      Permit not for one hour, A blossom from thy crown to drop,      Nor add to it a flower!

Life left my loaded heart, and closing eye; A sigh recall'd the wanderer to my breast; Dear was the pause of life, and dear the sigh  That call'd the wanderer home, and home to rest. That tear proclaims--in thee each virtue dwells, And bright will shine in misery's midnight hour; As the soft star of dewy evening tells What radiant fires were drown'd by day's malignant pow'r, That only wait the darkness of the night To cheer the wand'ring wretch with hospitable light. \r\n                         \n", "The Horn Of Egremont Castle": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        ERE the Brothers through the gateway Issued forth with old and young, To the Horn Sir Eustace pointed Which for ages there had hung. Horn it was which none could sound, No one upon living ground, Save He who came as rightful Heir To Egremont's Domains and Castle fair.  Heirs from times of earliest record Had the House of Lucie born,  Who of right had held the Lordship Claimed by proof upon the Horn: Each at the appointed hour Tried the Horn,--it owned his power; He was acknowledged: and the blast, Which good Sir Eustace sounded, was the last.  With his lance Sir Eustace pointed, And to Hubert thus said he, 'What I speak this Horn shall witness For thy better memory.  Hear, then, and neglect me not! At this time, and on this spot, The words are uttered from my heart, As my last earnest prayer ere we depart.  'On good service we are going Life to risk by sea and land, In which course if Christ our Saviour Do my sinful soul demand, Hither come thou back straightway, Hubert, if alive that day;  Return, and sound the Horn, that we May have a living House still left in thee!'  'Fear not,' quickly answered Hubert; 'As I am thy Father's son, What thou askest, noble Brother, With God's favour shall be done.' So were both right well content: Forth they from the Castle went, And at the head of their Array To Palestine the Brothers took their way.   Side by side they fought (the Lucies Were a line for valour famed), And where'er their strokes alighted, There the Saracens were tamed. Whence, then, could it come--the thought-- By what evil spirit brought? Oh! can a brave Man wish to take His Brother's life, for Lands' and Castle's sake?  'Sir!' the Ruffians said to Hubert, 'Deep he lies in Jordan flood.'  Stricken by this ill assurance, Pale and trembling Hubert stood. 'Take your earnings.'--Oh! that I Could have 'seen' my Brother die! It was a pang that vexed him then; And oft returned, again, and yet again.  Months passed on, and no Sir Eustace! Nor of him were tidings heard; Wherefore, bold as day, the Murderer Back again to England steered.  To his Castle Hubert sped; Nothing has he now to dread. But silent and by stealth he came, And at an hour which nobody could name.  None could tell if it were night-time, Night or day, at even or morn; No one's eye had seen him enter, No one's ear had heard the Horn. But bold Hubert lives in glee: Months and years went smilingly;  With plenty was his table spread; And bright the Lady is who shares his bed.  Likewise he had sons and daughters; And, as good men do, he sate At his board by these surrounded, Flourishing in fair estate. And while thus in open day Once he sate, as old books say, A blast was uttered from the Horn, Where by the Castle-gate it hung forlorn.   'Tis the breath of good Sir Eustace! He is come to claim his right: Ancient castle, woods, and mountains Hear the challenge with delight. Hubert! though the blast be blown He is helpless and alone: Thou hast a dungeon, speak the word! And there he may be lodged, and thou be Lord.  Speak!--astounded Hubert cannot; And, if power to speak he had,  All are daunted, all the household Smitten to the heart, and sad. 'Tis Sir Eustace; if it be Living man, it must be he! Thus Hubert thought in his dismay, And by a postern-gate he slunk away.  Long, and long was he unheard of: To his Brother then he came, Made confession, asked forgiveness, Asked it by a brother's name,  And by all the saints in heaven; And of Eustace was forgiven: Then in a convent went to hide His melancholy head, and there he died.  But Sir Eustace, whom good angels Had preserved from murderers' hands, And from Pagan chains had rescued, Lived with honour on his lands. Sons he had, saw sons of theirs: And through ages, heirs of heirs,  A long posterity renowned, Sounded the Horn which they alone could sound. \r\n                         \n", "The Idle Shepherd Boys": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        The valley rings with mirth and joy; Among the hills the echoes play A never never ending song, To welcome in the May. The magpie chatters with delight; The mountain raven's youngling brood Have left the mother and the nest; And they go rambling east and west In search of their own food; Or through the glittering vapors dart In very wantonness of heart.  Beneath a rock, upon the grass, Two boys are sitting in the sun; Their work, if any work they have, Is out of mind---or done. On pipes of sycamore they play The fragments of a Christmas hymn; Or with that plant which in our dale We call stag-horn, or fox's tail, Their rusty hats they trim: And thus, as happy as the day, Those Shepherds wear the time away.  Along the river's stony marge The sand-lark chants a joyous song; The thrush is busy in the wood, And carols loud and strong. A thousand lambs are on the rocks, All newly born! both earth and sky Keep jubilee, and more than all, Those boys with their green coronal; They never hear the cry, That plaintive cry! which up the hill Comes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.  Said Walter, leaping from the ground, 'Down to the stump of yon old yew We'll for our whistles run a race.' Away the shepherds flew; They leapt---they ran---and when they came Right opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll, Seeing that he should lose the prize, 'Stop! ' to his comrade Walter cries--- James stopped with no good will: Said Walter then, exulting; 'Here You'll find a task for half a year.  Cross, if you dare, where I shall cross--- Come on, and tread where I shall tread.' The other took him at his word, And followed as he led. It was a spot which you may see If ever you to Langdale go; Into a chasm a mighty block Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock: The gulf is deep below; And, in a basin black and small, Receives a lofty waterfall.  With staff in hand across the cleft The challenger pursued his march; And now, all eyes and feet, hath gained The middle of the arch. When list! he hears a piteous moan--- Again !---his heart within him dies--- His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost, He totters, pallid as a ghost, And, looking down, espies A lamb, that in the pool is pent Within that black and frightful rent.  The lamb had slipped into the stream, And safe without a bruise or wound The cataract had borne him down Into the gulf profound. His dam had seen him when he fell, She saw him down the torrent borne; And, while with all a mother's love She from the lofty rocks above Sent forth a cry forlorn, The lamb, still swimming round and round, Made answer to that plaintive sound.  When he had learnt what thing it was, That sent this rueful cry; I ween The Boy recovered heart, and told The sight which he had seen. Both gladly now deferred their task; Nor was there wanting other aid--- A Poet, one who loves the brooks Far better than the sages' books, By chance had thither strayed; And there the helpless lamb he found By those huge rocks encompassed round.  He drew it from the troubled pool, And brought it forth into the light: The Shepherds met him with his charge, An unexpected sight! Into their arms the lamb they took, Whose life and limbs the flood had spared; Then up the steep ascent they hied, And placed him at his mother's side; And gently did the Bard Those idle Shepherd-Boys upbraid, And bade them better mind their trade. \r\n                         \n", "The Sonnet Ii": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        SCORN not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frown'd,  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mindless of its just honours; with this key  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shakespeare unlock'd his heart; the melody  Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;  A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With it Cam\u00f6ens sooth'd an exile's grief;  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sonnet glitter'd a gay myrtle leaf  Amid the cypress with which Dante crown'd  His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It cheer'd mild Spenser, call'd from Faery-land  To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand  The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew  Soul-animating strains--alas, too few! \r\n                         \n", "Where Lies The Land To Which Yon Ship Must Go?": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        WHERE lies the Land to which yon Ship must go?

Rough is the time; and thoughts, that would be free  From heaviness, oft fly, dear Friend, to thee; Turn from a spot where neither sheltered road Nor hedge-row screen invites my steps abroad; Where one poor Plane-tree, having as it might Attained a stature twice a tall man's height, Hopeless of further growth, and brown and sere Through half the summer, stands with top cut sheer, Like an unshifting weathercock which proves How cold the quarter that the wind best loves, Or like a Centinel that, evermore  Darkening the window, ill defends the door Of this unfinished house--a Fortress bare, Where strength has been the Builder's only care; Whose rugged walls may still for years demand The final polish of the Plasterer's hand. --This Dwelling's Inmate more than three weeks space And oft a Prisoner in the cheerless place, I--of whose touch the fiddle would complain, Whose breath would labour at the flute in vain, In music all unversed, nor blessed with skill  A bridge to copy, or to paint a mill, Tired of my books, a scanty company! And tired of listening to the boisterous sea-- Pace between door and window muttering rhyme, An old resource to cheat a froward time! Though these dull hours (mine is it, or their shame?) Would tempt me to renounce that humble aim. --But if there be a Muse who, free to take Her seat upon Olympus, doth forsake Those heights (like Phoebus when his golden locks  He veiled, attendant on Thessalian flocks) And, in disguise, a Milkmaid with her pail Trips down the pathways of some winding dale; Or, like a Mermaid, warbles on the shores To fishers mending nets beside their doors; Or, Pilgrim-like, on forest moss reclined, Gives plaintive ditties to the heedless wind, Or listens to its play among the boughs Above her head and so forgets her vows-- If such a Visitant of Earth there be  And she would deign this day to smile on me And aid my verse, content with local bounds Of natural beauty and life's daily rounds, Thoughts, chances, sights, or doings, which we tell Without reserve to those whom we love well-- Then haply, Beaumont! words in current clear Will flow, and on a welcome page appear Duly before thy sight, unless they perish here. What shall I treat of? News from Mona's Isle? Such have we, but unvaried in its style;  No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whence And wherefore fugitive or on what pretence; Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the wind Most restlessly alive when most confined. Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appease The mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS; The last year's cup whose Ram or Heifer gained, What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained: An eye of fancy only can I cast On that proud pageant now at hand or past,  When full five hundred boats in trim array, With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay, And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer, For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair, Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shine Like beds of moonlight shifting on the brine. Mona from our Abode is daily seen, But with a wilderness of waves between; And by conjecture only can we speak Of aught transacted there in bay or creek;  No tidings reach us thence from town or field, Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield, And some we gather from the misty air, And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare. But these poetic mysteries I withhold; For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold, And should the colder fit with You be on When You might read, my credit would be gone. Let more substantial themes the pen engage, And nearer interests culled from the opening stage  Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawn Had from the east her silver star withdrawn, The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door, Thoughtfully freighted with a various store; And long or ere the uprising of the Sun O'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun, A needful journey, under favouring skies, Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guise Of those old Patriarchs when from well to well They roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabs dwell.  Say first, to whom did we the charge confide, Who promptly undertook the Wain to guide Up many a sharply-twining road and down, And over many a wide hill's craggy crown, Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook, And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook? A blooming Lass--who in her better hand Bore a light switch, her sceptre of command When, yet a slender Girl, she often led, Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled  From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar's head. What could go wrong with such a Charioteer For goods and chattels, or those Infants dear, A Pair who smilingly sate side by side, Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tide Whose free embraces we were bound to seek, Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek? Such hope did either Parent entertain Pacing behind along the silent lane. Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight,  For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight-- On a green bank a creature stood forlorn Just half protruded to the light of morn, Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thorn The Figure called to mind a beast of prey Stript of its frightful powers by slow decay, And, though no longer upon rapine bent, Dim memory keeping of its old intent. We started, looked again with anxious eyes, And in that griesly object recognise  The Curate's Dog--his long-tried friend, for they, As well we knew, together had grown grey. The Master died, his drooping servant's grief Found at the Widow's feet some sad relief; Yet still he lived in pining discontent, Sadness which no indulgence could prevent; Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleeps And lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps; Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute! Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute,  And of all visible motion destitute, So that the very heaving of his breath Seemed stopt, though by some other power than death. Long as we gazed upon the form and face, A mild domestic pity kept its place, Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hue That haunted us in spite of what we knew. Even now I sometimes think of him as lost In second-sight appearances, or crost By spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground,  On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound, Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to wait In days of old romance at Archimago's gate. Advancing Summer, Nature's law fulfilled, The choristers in every grove had stilled; But we, we lacked not music of our own, For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown, Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues, Some notes prelusive, from the round of songs With which, more zealous than the liveliest bird  That in wild Arden's brakes was ever heard, Her work and her work's partners she can cheer, The whole day long, and all days of the year. Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we pass And soon approach Diana's Looking-glass! To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven, Such name Italian fancy would have given, Ere on its banks the few grey cabins rose That yet disturb not its concealed repose More than the feeblest wind that idly blows.  Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the road Stopped me at once by charm of what it showed, The encircling region vividly exprest Within the mirror's depth, a world at rest-- Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield, And the smooth green of many a pendent field, And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small, A little daring would-be waterfall, One chimney smoking and its azure wreath, Associate all in the calm Pool beneath,  With here and there a faint imperfect gleam Of water-lilies veiled in misty steam-- What wonder at this hour of stillness deep, A shadowy link 'tween wakefulness and sleep, When Nature's self, amid such blending, seems To render visible her own soft dreams, If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood, Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood, A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by Thee Designed to rise in humble privacy,  A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread, Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful head Half hid in native trees. Alas 'tis not, Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spot Unconscious of its own untoward lot, And thought in silence, with regret too keen, Of unexperienced joys that might have been; Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts, And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts. But time, irrevocable time, is flown.  And let us utter thanks for blessings sown And reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own. Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee, Startling us all, dispersed my reverie; Such shout as many a sportive echo meeting Oft-times from Alpine 'chalets' sends a greeting. Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant stand On high, a kerchief waving in her hand! Not unexpectant that by early day Our little Band would thrid this mountain way,  Before her cottage on the bright hill side She hath advanced with hope to be descried. Right gladly answering signals we displayed, Moving along a tract of morning shade, And vocal wishes sent of like good will To our kind Friend high on the sunny hill-- Luminous region, fair as if the prime Were tempting all astir to look aloft or climb; Only the centre of the shining cot With door left open makes a gloomy spot,  Emblem of those dark corners sometimes found Within the happiest breast on earthly ground. Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale, And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale; Descend, and reach, in Yewdale's depths, a plain With haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain-- An area level as a Lake and spread Under a rock too steep for man to tread, Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwest Aloft the Raven hangs a visible nest,  Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest. Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark, At our approach, a jealous watch-dog's bark, Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state, But the whole household, that our coming wait. With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange, And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly Grange Press forward by the teasing dogs unscared. Entering, we find the morning meal prepared: So down we sit, though not till each had cast  Pleased looks around the delicate repast-- Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest, With amber honey from the mountain's breast; Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wild Of children's industry, in hillocks piled; Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lie Upon a lordly dish; frank hospitality Where simple art with bounteous nature vied, And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride. Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast,  If thou be lovelier than the kindling East, Words by thy presence unrestrained may speak Of a perpetual dawn from brow and cheek Instinct with light whose sweetest promise lies, Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes, Dark but to every gentle feeling true, As if their lustre flowed from ether's purest blue. Let me not ask what tears may have been wept By those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept, Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved  For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relieved By fortitude and patience, and the grace Of heaven in pity visiting the place. Not unadvisedly those secret springs I leave unsearched: enough that memory clings, Here as elsewhere, to notices that make Their own significance for hearts awake, To rural incidents, whose genial powers Filled with delight three summer morning hours. More cold my pen report of grave or gay  That through our gipsy travel cheered the way; But, bursting forth above the waves, the Sun Laughs at my pains, and seems to say, 'Be done.' Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reprove This humble offering made by Truth to Love, Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spell Which might have else been on me yet:-- FAREWELL. \r\n                         \n", "To The Supreme Being From The Italian Of Michael Angelo": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        THE prayers I make will then be sweet indeed If Thou the spirit give by which I pray: My unassisted heart is barren clay, That of its native self can nothing feed: Of good and pious works thou art the seed, That quickens only where thou say'st it may: Unless Thou show to us thine own true way No man can find it: Father! Thou must lead. Do Thou, then, breathe those thoughts into my mind By which such virtue may in me be bred  That in thy holy footsteps I may tread; The fetters of my tongue do Thou unbind, That I may have the power to sing of thee, And sound thy praises everlastingly. \r\n                         \n", "The Oak Of Guernica Supposed Address To The Same": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        OAK of Guernica!

II  'Wherefore in praise, the worthiest that I may, Jesu! of thee, and the white Lily-flower Which did thee bear, and is a Maid for aye, To tell a story I will use my power; Not that I may increase her honour's dower, For she herself is honour, and the root Of goodness, next her Son, our soul's best boot.  III  'O Mother Maid! O Maid and Mother free! O bush unburnt! burning in Moses' sight! That down didst ravish from the Deity, Through humbleness, the spirit that did alight Upon thy heart, whence, through that glory's might, Conceived was the Father's sapience, Help me to tell it in thy reverence!  IV  'Lady! thy goodness, thy magnificence, Thy virtue, and thy great humility, Surpass all science and all utterance; For sometimes, Lady! ere men pray to thee Thou goest before in thy benignity, The light to us vouchsafing of thy prayer, To be our guide unto thy Son so dear.

VI  'There was in Asia, in a mighty town, 'Mong Christian folk, a street where Jews might be, Assigned to them and given them for their own By a great Lord, for gain and usury, Hateful to Christ and to his company; And through this street who list might ride and wend; Free was it, and unbarred at either end.  VII  'A little school of Christian people stood Down at the farther end, in which there were A nest of children come of Christian blood, That learned in that school from year to year Such sort of doctrine as men used there, That is to say, to sing and read also, As little children in their childhood do.  VIII  'Among these children was a Widow's son, A little scholar, scarcely seven years old, Who day by day unto this school hath gone, And eke, when he the image did behold Of Jesu's Mother, as he had been told, This Child was wont to kneel adown and say 'Ave Marie,' as he goeth by the way.  IX  'This Widow thus her little Son hath taught Our blissful Lady, Jesu's Mother dear, To worship aye, and he forgat it not; For simple infant hath a ready ear. Sweet is the holiness of youth: and hence, Calling to mind this matter when I may, Saint Nicholas in my presence standeth aye, For he so young to Christ did reverence.  X  'This little Child, while in the school he sate His Primer conning with an earnest cheer, The whilst the rest their anthem-book repeat The 'Alma Redemptoris' did he hear; And as he durst he drew him near and near, And hearkened to the words and to the note, Till the first verse he learned it all by rote.  XI  'This Latin knew he nothing what it said, For he too tender was of age to know; But to his comrade he repaired, and prayed That he the meaning of this song would show, And unto him declare why men sing so; This oftentimes that he might be at ease, This child did him beseech on his bare knees.  XII  'His Schoolfellow, who elder was than he, Answered him thus:--'This song, I have heard say, Was fashioned for our blissful Lady free; Her to salute, and also her to pray To be our help upon our dying day: If there is more in this, I know it not; Song do I learn,--small grammar I have got.'  XIII  ''And is this song fashioned in reverence Of Jesu's Mother?' said this Innocent; 'Now, certes, I will use my diligence To con it all ere Christmas-tide be spent; Although I for my Primer shall be shent, And shall be beaten three times in an hour, Our Lady I will praise with all my power.'  XIV  'His Schoolfellow, whom he had so besought, As they went homeward taught him privily And then he sang it well and fearlessly, From word to word according to the note: Twice in a day it passed through his throat; Homeward and schoolward whensoe'er he went, On Jesu's Mother fixed was his intent.  XV  'Through all the Jewry (this before said I) This little Child, as he came to and fro, Full merrily then would he sing and cry, O 'Alma Redemptoris!' high and low: The sweetness of Christ's Mother pierced so His heart, that her to praise, to her to pray, He cannot stop his singing by the way.  XVI  'The Serpent, Satan, our first foe, that hath His wasp's nest in Jew's heart, upswelled--'O woe, O Hebrew people!' said he in his wrath, 'Is it an honest thing? Shall this be so? That such a Boy where'er he lists shall go In your despite, and sing his hymns and saws, Which is against the reverence of our laws!'  XVII  'From that day forward have the Jews conspired Out of the world this Innocent to chase; And to this end a Homicide they hired, That in an alley had a privy place, And, as the Child 'gan to the school to pace, This cruel Jew him seized, and held him fast And cut his throat, and in a pit him cast.  XVIII  'I say that him into a pit they threw, A loathsome pit, whence noisome scents exhale; O cursed folk! away, ye Herods new! What may your ill intentions you avail? Murder will out; certes it will not fail; Know, that the honour of high God may spread, The blood cries out on your accursed deed.  XIX  'O Martyr 'stablished in virginity! Now may'st thou sing for aye before the throne, Following the Lamb celestial,' quoth she, 'Of which the great Evangelist, Saint John, In Patmos wrote, who saith of them that go Before the Lamb singing continually, That never fleshly woman they did know.  XX  'Now this poor widow waiteth all that night After her little Child, and he came not; For which, by earliest glimpse of morning light, With face all pale with dread and busy thought, She at the School and elsewhere him hath sought Until thus far she learned, that he had been In the Jews' street, and there he last was seen.  XXI  'With Mother's pity in her breast enclosed She goeth, as she were half out of her mind, To every place wherein she hath supposed By likelihood her little Son to find; And ever on Christ's Mother meek and kind She cried, till to the Jewry she was brought, And him among the accursed Jews she sought.  XXII  'She asketh, and she piteously doth pray To every Jew that dwelleth in that place To tell her if her child had passed that way; They all said--Nay; but Jesu of his grace Gave to her thought, that in a little space She for her Son in that same spot did cry Where he was cast into a pit hard by.  XXIII  'O thou great God that dost perform thy laud By mouths of Innocents, lo! here thy might; This gem of chastity, this emerald, And eke of martyrdom this ruby bright, There, where with mangled throat he lay upright, The 'Alma Redemptoris' 'gan to sing, So loud, that with his voice the place did ring.  XXIV  'The Christian folk that through the Jewry went Come to the spot in wonder at the thing; And hastily they for the Provost sent; Immediately he came, not tarrying, And praiseth Christ that is our heavenly King, And eke his Mother, honour of Mankind: Which done he bade that they the Jews should bind.  XXV  'This Child with piteous lamentation then Was taken up, singing his song alway; And with procession great and pomp of men To the next Abbey him they bare away; His Mother swooning by the body lay: And scarcely could the people that were near Remove this second Rachel from the bier.  XXVI  'Torment and shameful death to every one This Provost doth for those bad Jews prepare That of this murder wist, and that anon: Such wickedness his judgments cannot spare; Who will do evil, evil shall he bear; Them therefore with wild horses did he draw, And after that he hung them by the law.  XXVII  'Upon his bier this Innocent doth lie Before the altar while the Mass doth last: The Abbot with his convent's company Then sped themselves to bury him full fast; And, when they holy water on him cast, Yet spake this Child when sprinkled was the water, And sang, 'O Alma Redemptoris Mater!'  XXVIII  'This Abbot, for he was a holy man, As all Monks are, or surely ought to be, In supplication to the Child began Thus saying, 'O dear Child! I summon thee In virtue of the holy Trinity Tell me the cause why thou dost sing this hymn Since that thy throat is cut, as it doth seem.'  XXIX  ''My throat is cut unto the bone, I trow,' Said this young Child, 'and by the law of kind I should have died, yea many hours ago; But Jesus Christ, as in the books ye find, Will that his glory last, and be in mind; And, for the worship of his Mother dear, Yet may I sing 'O Alma!' loud and clear.  XXX  ''This well of mercy, Jesu's Mother sweet, After my knowledge I have loved alway; And in the hour when I my death did meet To me she came, and thus to me did say, 'Thou in thy dying sing this holy lay,' As ye have heard; and soon as I had sung Methought she laid a grain upon my tongue.  XXXI  ''Wherefore I sing, nor can from song refrain, In honour of that blissful Maiden free, Till from my tongue off-taken is the grain; And after that thus said she unto me; 'My little Child, then will I come for thee Soon as the grain from off thy tongue they take: Be not dismayed, I will not thee forsake!'  XXXII  'This holy Monk, this Abbot--him mean I, Touched then his tongue, and took away the grain; And he gave up the ghost full peacefully; And, when the Abbot had this wonder seen, His salt tears trickled down like showers of rain; And on his face he dropped upon the ground, And still he lay as if he had been bound.  XXXIII  'Eke the whole Convent on the pavement lay, Weeping and praising Jesu's Mother dear; And after that they rose, and took their way, And lifted up this Martyr from the bier, And in a tomb of precious marble clear Enclosed his uncorrupted body sweet.-- Where'er he be, God grant us him to meet!  XXXIV  'Young Hew of Lincoln! in like sort laid low By cursed Jews--thing well and widely known, For it was done a little while ago-- Pray also thou for us, while here we tarry Weak sinful folk, that God, with pitying eye, In mercy would his mercy multiply On us, for reverence of his Mother Mary!' \r\n                         \n", "To The Poet, John Dyer": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        BARD of the Fleece, whose skilful genius made That work a living landscape fair and bright; Nor hallowed less with musical delight Than those soft scenes through which thy childhood strayed, Those southern tracts of Cambria, 'deep embayed, With green hills fenced, with ocean's murmur lulled;' Though hasty Fame hath many a chaplet culled For worthless brows, while in the pensive shade Of cold neglect she leaves thy head ungraced, Yet pure and powerful minds, hearts meek and still,  A grateful few, shall love thy modest Lay, Long as the shepherd's bleating flock shall stray O'er naked Snowdon's wide aerial waste; Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill! \r\n                         \n", "Translation Of Part Of The First Book Of The Aeneid": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        THE EDITORS OF THE PHILOLOGICAL MUSEUM  BUT Cytherea, studious to invent Arts yet untried, upon new counsels bent, Resolves that Cupid, changed in form and face To young Ascanius, should assume his place; Present the maddening gifts, and kindle heat Of passion at the bosom's inmost seat. She dreads the treacherous house, the double tongue; She burns, she frets--by Juno's rancour stung; The calm of night is powerless to remove These cares, and thus she speaks to winged Love:   'O son, my strength, my power! who dost despise (What, save thyself, none dares through earth and skies) The giant-quelling bolts of Jove, I flee, O son, a suppliant to thy deity! What perils meet Aeneas in his course, How Juno's hate with unrelenting force Pursues thy brother--this to thee is known; And oft-times hast thou made my griefs thine own. Him now the generous Dido by soft chains Of bland entreaty at her court detains;  Junonian hospitalities prepare Such apt occasion that I dread a snare. Hence, ere some hostile God can intervene, Would I, by previous wiles, inflame the queen With passion for Aeneas, such strong love That at my beck, mine only, she shall move. Hear, and assist;--the father's mandate calls His young Ascanius to the Tyrian walls; He comes, my dear delight,--and costliest things Preserved from fire and flood for presents brings.  Him will I take, and in close covert keep, 'Mid groves Idalian, lulled to gentle sleep, Or on Cythera's far-sequestered steep, That he may neither know what hope is mine, Nor by his presence traverse the design. Do thou, but for a single night's brief space, Dissemble; be that boy in form and face! And when enraptured Dido shall receive Thee to her arms, and kisses interweave With many a fond embrace, while joy runs high,  And goblets crown the proud festivity, Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire, At every touch, an unsuspected fire.'  Love, at the word, before his mother's sight Puts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight, Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dews Of slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuse The true Ascanius steeped in placid rest; Then wafts him, cherished on her careful breast, Through upper air to an Idalian glade,  Where he on soft 'amaracus' is laid, With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade. But Cupid, following cheerily his guide Achates, with the gifts to Carthage hied; And, as the hall he entered, there, between The sharers of her golden couch, was seen Reclined in festal pomp the Tyrian queen. The Trojans, too (Aeneas at their head), On conches lie, with purple overspread: Meantime in canisters is heaped the bread,  Pellucid water for the hands is borne, And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn. Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare, As they in order stand, the dainty fare; And fume the household deities with store Of odorous incense; while a hundred more Matched with an equal number of like age, But each of manly sex, a docile page, Marshal the banquet, giving with due grace To cup or viand its appointed place.  The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band, Their painted couches seek, obedient to command. They look with wonder on the gifts--they gaze Upon Iulus, dazzled with the rays That from his ardent countenance are flung, And charmed to hear his simulating tongue; Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine, Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.  But chiefly Dido, to the coming ill Devoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill;  She views the gifts; upon the child then turns Insatiable looks, and gazing burns. To ease a father's cheated love he hung Upon Aeneas, and around him clung; Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries; She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes, Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!) How great a God, incumbent o'er her breast, Would fill it with his spirit. He, to please His Acidalian mother, by degrees  Blots out Sichaeus, studious to remove The dead, by influx of a living love, By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest. Troubling a heart that had been long at rest.  Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceased The first division of the splendid feast, While round a vacant board the chiefs recline, Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine; Voices of gladness roll the walls around; Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound;  From gilded rafters many a blazing light Depends, and torches overcome the night. The minutes fly--till, at the queen's command, A bowl of state is offered to her hand: Then she, as Belus wont, and all the line From Belus, filled it to the brim with wine; Silence ensued. 'O Jupiter, whose care Is hospitable dealing, grant my prayer! Productive day be this of lasting joy To Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy;  A day to future generations dear! Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick'ning cheer, Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near! And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours wait Upon this hour, the bond to celebrate!' She spake and shed an offering on the board; Then sipped the bowl whence she the wine had poured And gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord; He raised the bowl, and took a long deep draught; Then every chief in turn the beverage quaffed.   Graced with redundant hair, Iopas sings The lore of Atlas, to resounding strings, The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings; When human kind, and brute; what natural powers Engender lightning, whence are falling showers. He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twain The glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain; --Why suns in winter, shunning heaven's steep heights Post seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights. The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws  Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause. --But, lengthening out the night with converse new, Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew; Of Priam asked, of Hector--o'er and o'er-- What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;-- What steeds the car of Diomed could boast; Among the leaders of the Grecian host. How looked Achilles, their dread paramount-- 'But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount, Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source,  Your own grief and your friends?--your wandering course; For now, till this seventh summer have ye ranged The sea, or trod the earth, to peace estranged.' \r\n                         \n", "To The Same (John Dyer)": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        ENOUGH of climbing toil!--Ambition treads Here, as 'mid busier scenes, ground steep and rough, Or slippery even to peril! and each step, As we for most uncertain recompence Mount toward the empire of the fickle clouds, Each weary step, dwarfing the world below, Induces, for its old familiar sights, Unacceptable feelings of contempt, With wonder mixed--that Man could e'er be tied, In anxious bondage, to such nice array  And formal fellowship of petty things! --Oh!

Long as the heat shall rage, let that dim cave Protect us, there deciphering as we may Diluvian records; or the sighs of Earth Interpreting; or counting for old Time His minutes, by reiterated drops, Audible tears, from some invisible source That deepens upon fancy--more and more Drawn toward the centre whence those sighs creep forth To awe the lightness of humanity:  Or, shutting up thyself within thyself, There let me see thee sink into a mood Of gentler thought, protracted till thine eye Be calm as water when the winds are gone, And no one can tell whither.

We two have known such happy hours together That, were power granted to replace them (fetched From out the pensive shadows where they lie) In the first warmth of their original sunshine, Loth should I be to use it: passing sweet  Are the domains of tender memory! \r\n                         \n", "Descriptive Sketches Taken During A Pedestrian Tour Among The Alps": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        WERE there, below, a spot of holy ground       Where from distress a refuge might be found,       And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;        Sure, nature's God that spot to man had given       Where falls the purple morning far and wide       In flakes of light upon the mountain side;        Where with loud voice the power of water shakes       The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.         Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,       Who at the call of summer quits his home,          And plods through some wide realm o'er vale and height,       Though seeking only holiday delight;        At least, not owning to himself an aim       To which the sage would give a prouder name.       No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,       Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;        Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,       Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.

Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head,       And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:       Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day's flaming eye?        Upward he looks- 'and calls it luxury:'       Kind Nature's charities his steps attend;        In every babbling brook he finds a friend;        While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed       By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.       Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,       To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;          He views the sun uplift his golden fire,       Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon's lyre;        Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,       To light him shaken by his rugged way.       Back from his sight no bashful children steal;        He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;        His humble looks no shy restraint impart;        Around him plays at will the virgin heart.       While unsuspended wheels the village dance,       The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,            Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,       Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.         A hope, that prudence could not then approve,       That clung to Nature with a truant's love,       O'er Gallia's wastes of corn my footsteps led;        Her files of road-elms, high above my head       In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;        Or where her pathways straggle as they please       By lonely farms and secret villages.

The thundering tube the aged angler hears,       Bent o'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.       Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,       Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o'erspreads;        Strong terror checks the female peasant's sighs,       And start the astonished shades at female eyes.       From Bruno's forest screams the affrighted jay,       And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.       A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock       The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock.        The 'parting Genius' sighs with hollow breath       Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.       Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds       Portentous through her old woods' trackless bounds,       Vallombre, 'mid her falling fanes, deplores,       For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.         More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves       Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.       No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps       Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.          - To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,       From ringing team apart and grating wain-        To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water's bound,       Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,       Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,       And o'er the whitened wave their shadows fling-        The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;        And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.       The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees       From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;           Or marks, 'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids       Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;        Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view       Stretch o'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,       And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,       As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.       Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed       In golden light; half hides itself in shade:       While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,       Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire:        There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw       Rich golden verdure on the lake below.       Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,       And steals into the shade the lazy oar;        Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,       And amorous music on the water dies.       How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets       Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;        Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales       Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales;              Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,       Each with its household boat beside the door;        Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;        Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows' nests, on high;        That glimmer hoar in eve's last light, descried       Dim from the twilight water's shaggy side,       Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods       Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;        Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,       'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning's ray            Slow-travelling down the western hills, to enfold       Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;        Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell       Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,       And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass       Along the steaming lake, to early mass.       But now farewell to each and all- adieu       To every charm, and last and chief to you,       Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade       Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;             To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,       Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;        Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume       The sylvan cabin's lute-enlivened gloom.       - Alas! the very murmur of the streams       Breathes o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,       While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell       On joys that might disgrace the captive's cell,       Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como's marge,       And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.           Yet are thy softer arts with power indued       To soothe and cheer the poor man's solitude.       By silent cottage-doors, the peasant's home       Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.       But once I pierced the mazes of a wood       In which a cabin undeserted stood;        There an old man an olden measure scanned       On a rude viol touched with withered hand.       As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie       Under a hoary oak's thin canopy,                     Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,       His children's children listened to the sound;        - A Hermit with his family around!          But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles       Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:       Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa's stream,       Where, 'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.       From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire       The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire       To where afar rich orange lustres glow                Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:       Or, led where Via Mala's chasms confine       The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,       Hang o'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom       His burning eyes with fearful light illume.         The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go       O'er life's long deserts with its charge of woe,       With sad congratulation joins the train       Where beasts and men together o'er the plain       Move on- a mighty caravan of pain:                  Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,       Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.       - There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:       Sole human tenant of the piny waste,       By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,       A nursling babe her only comforter;        Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,       A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!          When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows       Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,               And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad       Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road-        She seeks a covert from the battering shower       In the roofed bridge; a the bridge, ill that dread hour,       Itself all trembling at the torrent's power.         Nor is she more at ease on some 'still' night,       When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;        Only the waning moon hangs dull and red       Above a melancholy mountain's head,       Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,               Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;        Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,       Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,       Listens, or quakes while from the forest's gulf       Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf.         From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide       Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide;        By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,       Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;        By cells upon whose image, while he prays,               The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;        By many a votive death-cross planted near,       And watered duly with the pious tear,       That faded silent from the upward eye       Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh;        Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves       Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves.         But soon a peopled region on the sight       Opens- a little world of calm delight;        Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,              Spread rooflike o'er the deep secluded vale,       And beams of evening slipping in between,       Gently illuminate a sober scene:-        Here, on the brown wood-cottages they sleep,       There, over rock or sloping pasture creep.       On as we journey, in clear view displayed,       The still vale lengthens underneath its shade       Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead       The green light sparkles; - the dim bowers recede.       While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,          And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,       In solemn shapes before the admiring eye       Dilated hang the misty pines on high,       Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,       And antique castles seen through gleamy showers.         From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!        To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri's lake       In Nature's pristine majesty outspread,       Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread:       The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch                Far o'er the water, hung with groves of beech;        Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,       Nor stop but where creation seems to end.       Yet here and there, if mid the savage scene       Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,       Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep       To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep,       - Before those thresholds (never can they know       The face of traveller passing to and fro,)        No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell                  For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;        Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark foregoes,       Touched by the beggar's moan of human woes;        The shady porch ne'er offered a cool seat       To pilgrims overcome by summer's heat.       Yet thither the world's business finds its way       At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,       And 'there' are those fond thoughts which Solitude,       However stern, is powerless to exclude.       There doth the maiden watch her lover's sail                 Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;        At midnight listens till his parting oar,       And its last echo, can be heard no more.         And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons, cry       Amid tempestuous vapours driving by,       Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear       That common growth of earth, the foodful ear;        Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,       And pines the unripened pear in summer's kindliest ray;        Contentment shares the desolate domain                      With Independence, child of high Disdain.       Exulting 'mid the winter of the skies,       Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,       And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;        And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds       The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,       And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,       Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste       Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast.         Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour,            All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:       The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:       Dark is the region as with coming night;        But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!        Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,       Glances the wheeling eagle's glorious form!        Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine       The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline;        Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold,       At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:             Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun       The 'west', that burns like one dilated sun,       A crucible of mighty compass, felt       By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt.         But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before       The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;        Confused the Marathonian tale appears,       While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears.       And who, that walks where men of ancient days       Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,               Feels not the spirit of the place control,       Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul?        Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,       Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,       On Zutphen's plain; or on that highland dell,       Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell       What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought       Of him whom passion rivets to the spot,       Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe's happiest sigh,       And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard's eye;                     Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,       And glad Dundee in 'faint huzzas' expired?          But now with other mind I stand alone       Upon the summit of this naked cone,       And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase       His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space,         Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave       A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,       Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;        Thro' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;           Where silent Hours their deathlike sway extend,       Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend       Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned       In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,       Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound.       - 'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,       To see a planet's pomp and steady light       In the least star of scarce-appearing night;        While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound       Of ether, shining with diminished round,                     And far and wide the icy summits blaze,       Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:       To him the day-star glitters small and bright,       Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,       And he can look beyond the sun, and view       Those fast-receding depths of sable blue       Flying till vision can no more pursue!        - At once bewildering mists around him close,       And cold and hunger are his least of woes;        The Demon of the snow, with angry roar                        Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.       Soon with despair's whole weight his spirits sink;        Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;        And, ere his eyes can close upon the day,       The eagle of the Alps o'ershades her prey.         Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar,       Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;        Or rather stay to taste the mild delights       Of pensive Underwalden's pastoral heights.       - Is there who 'mid these awful wilds has seen                  The native Genii walk the mountain green?        Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,       Soft music o'er the aerial summit steal?        While o'er the desert, answering every close,       Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.       - And sure there is a secret Power that reigns       Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,       Nought but the 'chalets', flat and bare, on high       Suspended 'mid the quiet of the sky;        Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,                 And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep.       How still! no irreligious sound or sight       Rouses the soul from her severe delight.       An idle voice the sabbath region fills       Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,       And with that voice accords the soothing sound       Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;        Faint wail of eagle melting into blue       Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods' steady 'sugh';        The solitary heifer's deepened low;                         Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow.       All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,       Blend in a music of tranquillity;        Save when, a stranger seen below, the boy       Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.         When, from the sunny breast of open seas,       And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze       Comes on to gladden April with the sight       Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height;        When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,               And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,       The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,       Leaving to silence the deserted vale;        And like the Patriarchs in their simple age       Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage:       High and more high in summer's heat they go,       And hear the rattling thunder far below;        Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,       Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd.         One I behold who, 'cross the foaming flood,               Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;        Another, high on that green ledge; - he gained       The tempting spot with every sinew strained;        And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,       Food for his beasts in time of winter snows.       - Far different life from what Tradition hoar       Transmits of happier lot in times of yore!        Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed       From out the rocks, the wild bees' safe abode:       Continual waters welling cheered the waste,                And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:       Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,       Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:       Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,       To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare.       Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,       And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,       Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand.       Thus does the father to his children tell       Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well.           Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod       Of angry Nature to avenge her God.       Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts       Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.         'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows       More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.       Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,       A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,       A solemn sea! whose billows wide around       Stand motionless, to awful silence bound:               Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,       That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.       A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,       Gapes in the centre of the sea- and, through       That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound       Innumerable streams with roar profound.       Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,       And merry flageolet; the low of herds,       The bark of dogs, the heifer's tinkling bell,       Talk, laughter, and perchance a churchtower knell:        Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed       And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised:       Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less       Alive to independent happiness,       Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at eventide       Upon the fragrant mountain's purple side:       For as the pleasures of his simple day       Beyond his native valley seldom stray,       Nought round its darling precincts can he find       But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;            While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure's urn,       Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return.         Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,       Was blest as free- for he was Nature's child.       He, all superior but his God disdained,       Walked none restraining, and by none restrained       Confessed no law but what his reason taught,       Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought.       As man in his primeval dower arrayed       The image of his glorious Sire displayed,                  Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here       The traces of primeval Man appear;        The simple dignity no forms debase;        The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:       The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,       His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword;        Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared       With this 'the blessings he enjoys to guard.'         And, as his native hills encircle ground       For many a marvellous victory renowned,                 The work of Freedom daring to oppose,       With few in arms, innumerable foes,       When to those famous fields his steps are led,       An unknown power connects him with the dead:       For images of other worlds are there;        Awful the light, and holy is the air.       Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,       Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;        His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,       Beyond the senses and their little reign.                   And oft, when that dread vision hath past by,       He holds with God himself communion high,       There where the peal of swelling torrents fills       The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;        Or when, upon the mountain's silent brow       Reclined, he sees, above him and below,       Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;        While needle peaks of granite shooting bare       Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.       And when a gathering weight of shadows brown              Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;        And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms,       Uplift in quiet their illumined forms,       In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,       Tinged like an angel's smile all rosy red-        Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,       And the near heavens impart their own delights.         When downward to his winter hut he goes,       Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;        That hut which on the hills so oft employs                His thoughts, the central point of all his joys.       And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,       Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,       So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends       A little prattling child, he oft descends,       To glance a look upon the well-matched pair;        Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.       There, safely guarded by the woods behind,       He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,       Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,            And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound.         Through Nature's vale his homely pleasures glide,       Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;        The bound of all his vanity, to deck,       With one bright bell, a favourite heifer's neck;        Well pleased upon some simple annual feast,       Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,       If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,       Of thrice ten summers dignify the board.       - Alas! in every clime a flying ray                         Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;        And here the unwilling mind may more than trace       The general sorrows of the human race;        The churlish gales of penury, that blow       Cold as the north-wind o'er a waste of snow,       To them the gentle groups of bliss deny       That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.       Yet more; - compelled by Powers which only deign       That 'solitary' man disturb their reign,       Powers that support an unremitting strife                With all the tender charities of life,       Full oft the father, when his sons have grown       To manhood, seems their title to disown;        And from his nest amid the storms of heaven       Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;        With stern composure watches to the plain-        And never, eagle-like, beholds again!          When long-familiar joys are all resigned,       Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind?        Lo! where through flat Batavia's willowy groves,            Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;        O'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,       And search the affections to their inmost cell;        Sweet poison spreads along the listener's veins,       Turning past pleasures into mortal pains;        Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,       Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave.         Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!        Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume!        Fresh gales and dews of life's delicious morn,             And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!        Alas! the little joy to man allowed       Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud;        Or like the beauty in a flower installed,       Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.       Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,       And taught that pain is pleasure's natural heir,       We still confide in more than we can know;        Death would be else the favourite friend of woe.         'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,           Between interminable tracts of pine,       Within a temple stands an awful shrine,       By an uncertain light revealed, that falls       On the mute Image and the troubled walls.       Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain       That views, undimmed, Einsiedlen's wretched fane.       While ghastly faces through the gloom appear,       Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear;        While prayer contends with silenced agony,       Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.                  If the sad grave of human ignorance bear       One flower of hope- oh, pass and leave it there!          The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire,       Flings o'er the wilderness a stream of fire:       Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day       Close on the remnant of their weary way;        While they are drawing toward the sacred floor       Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more.       How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste       The fountains reared for them amid the waste!            Their thirst they slake:- they wash their toil-worn feet       And some with tears of joy each other greet.       Yes, I must see you when ye first behold       Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,       In that glad moment will for you a sigh       Be heaved, of charitable sympathy;        In that glad moment when your hands are prest       In mute devotion on the thankful breast!          Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields       With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields:            Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,       And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend; -        A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns       Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;        Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:       'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned,       They sport beneath that mountain's matchless height       That holds no commerce with the summer night.       From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds       The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;                      Appalling havoc! but serene his brow,       Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow;        Glitter the stars above, and all is black below.         What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,       While roars the sullen Arve in anger by,       That not for thy reward, unrivalled Vale!        Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;        That thou, the slaves of slaves, art doomed to pine       And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,       To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine.              Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,       With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way,       On the bleak sides of Cumbria's heath-clad moors,       Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland's shores;        To scent the sweets of Piedmont's breathing rose,       And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows;        Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,       That virtue languishes and pleasure fails,       While the remotest hamlets blessings share       In thy loved presence known, and only there;                  'Heart'-blessings- outward treasures too which the eye       Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,       And every passing breeze will testify.       There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound       Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound;        The housewife there a brighter garden sees,       Where hum on busier wing her happy bees;        On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;        And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,-        To greet the traveller needing food and rest;             Housed for the night, or but a half-hour's guest.         And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees       Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;        Though martial songs have banished songs of love,       And nightingales desert the village grove,       Scared by the fife and rumbling drum's alarms,       And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;        That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,       Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!        - Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power          Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:       All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes       Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.       Yes, as I roamed where Loiret's waters glide       Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,       When from October clouds a milder light       Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;        Methought from every cot the watchful bird       Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;        Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,             Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;        Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf       Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief;        The measured echo of the distant flail       Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;        With more majestic course the water rolled,       And ripening foliage shone with richer gold.       - But foes are gathering- Liberty must raise       Red on the hills her beacon's far-seen blaze;        Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower! -               Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour!        Rejoice, brave Land, though pride's perverted ire       Rouse hell's own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:       Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;        As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth!        - All cannot be: the promise is too fair       For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:       Yet not for this will sober reason frown       Upon that promise, nor the hope disown;        She knows that only from high aims ensue                      Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due.         Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed       In an impartial balance, give thine aid       To the just cause; and, oh! do thou preside       Over the mighty stream now spreading wide:       So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied       In copious showers, from earth by wholesome springs,       Brood o'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings!        And grant that every sceptred child of clay       Who cries presumptuous, 'Here the flood shall stay,'                  May in its progress see thy guiding hand,       And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand;        Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore,       Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more!          To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot       Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot       In timely sleep; and when, at break of day,       On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play,       With a light heart our course we may renew,       The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.                     1791 &amp; 1792. \r\n                         \n", "The Martial Courage Of A Day Is Vain": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        THE martial courage of a day is vain, An empty noise of death the battle's roar, If vital hope be wanting to restore, Or fortitude be wanting to sustain, Armies or kingdoms.

Thou that canst shed the bliss of gratitude On hearts howe'er insensible or rude; Whether thy punctual visitations smite The haughty towers where monarchs dwell; Or thou, impartial Sun, with presence bright Cheer'st the low threshold of the peasant's cell! Not unrejoiced I see thee climb the sky In naked splendour, clear from mist or haze, Or cloud approaching to divert the rays, Which even in deepest winter testify Thy power and majesty, Dazzling the vision that presumes to gaze. --Well does thine aspect usher in this Day; As aptly suits therewith that modest pace Submitted to the chains That bind thee to the path which God ordains That thou shalt trace, Till, with the heavens and earth, thou pass away! Nor less, the stillness of these frosty plains, Their utter stillness, and the silent grace Of yon ethereal summits white with snow, (Whose tranquil pomp and spotless purity Report of storms gone by To us who tread below) Do with the service of this Day accord. --Divinest Object which the uplifted eye Of mortal man is suffered to behold; Thou, who upon those snow-clad Heights has poured Meek lustre, nor forget'st the humble Vale; Thou who dost warm Earth's universal mould, And for thy bounty wert not unadored By pious men of old; Once more, heart-cheering Sun, I bid thee hail! Bright be thy course to-day, let not this promise fail!  II  'Mid the deep quiet of this morning hour, All nature seems to hear me while I speak, By feelings urged that do not vainly seek Apt language, ready as the tuneful notes That stream in blithe succession from the throats Of birds, in leafy bower, Warbling a farewell to a vernal shower. --There is a radiant though a short-lived flame, That burns for Poets in the dawning east; And oft my soul hath kindled at the same, When the captivity of sleep had ceased; But He who fixed immoveably the frame Of the round world, and built, by laws as strong, A solid refuge for distress-- The towers of righteousness; He knows that from a holier altar came The quickening spark of this day's sacrifice; Knows that the source is nobler whence doth rise The current of this matin song; That deeper far it lies Than aught dependent on the fickle skies.  III  Have we not conquered?--by the vengeful sword? Ah no, by dint of Magnanimity; That curbed the baser passions, and left free A loyal band to follow their liege Lord Clear-sighted Honour, and his staid Compeers, Along a track of most unnatural years; In execution of heroic deeds Whose memory, spotless as the crystal beads Of morning dew upon the untrodden meads, Shall live enrolled above the starry spheres. He, who in concert with an earthly string Of Britain's acts would sing, He with enraptured voice will tell Of One whose spirit no reverse could quell; Of One that 'mid the failing never failed-- Who paints how Britain struggled and prevailed Shall represent her labouring with an eye Of circumspect humanity; Shall show her clothed with strength and skill, All martial duties to fulfil; Firm as a rock in stationary fight; In motion rapid as the lightning's gleam; Fierce as a flood-gate bursting at midnight To rouse the wicked from their giddy dream-- Woe, woe to all that face her in the field! Appalled she may not be, and cannot yield.  IV  And thus is 'missed' the sole true glory That can belong to human story! At which they only shall arrive Who through the abyss of weakness dive. The very humblest are too proud of heart; And one brief day is rightly set apart For Him who lifteth up and layeth low; For that Almighty God to whom we owe, Say not that we have vanquished--but that we survive.  V  How dreadful the dominion of the impure! Why should the Song be tardy to proclaim That less than power unbounded could not tame That soul of Evil--which, from hell let loose, Had filled the astonished world with such abuse As boundless patience only could endure? --Wide-wasted regions--cities wrapt in flame-- Who sees, may lift a streaming eye To Heaven;--who never saw, may heave a sigh; But the foundation of our nature shakes, And with an infinite pain the spirit aches, When desolated countries, towns on fire, Are but the avowed attire Of warfare waged with desperate mind Against the life of virtue in mankind; Assaulting without ruth The citadels of truth; While the fair gardens of civility, By ignorance defaced, By violence laid waste, Perish without reprieve for flower or tree!  VI  A crouching purpose--a distracted will-- Opposed to hopes that battened upon scorn, And to desires whose ever-waxing horn Not all the light of earthly power could fill; Opposed to dark, deep plots of patient skill, And to celerities of lawless force; Which, spurning God, had flung away remorse-- What could they gain but shadows of redress? --So bad proceeded propagating worse; And discipline was passion's dire excess. Widens the fatal web, its lines extend, And deadlier poisons in the chalice blend. When will your trials teach you to be wise? --O prostrate Lands, consult your agonies!  VII  No more--the guilt is banished, And, with the guilt, the shame is fled; And, with the guilt and shame, the Woe hath vanished, Shaking the dust and ashes from her head! --No more--these lingerings of distress Sully the limpid stream of thankfulness. What robe can Gratitude employ So seemly as the radiant vest of Joy? What steps so suitable as those that move In prompt obedience to spontaneous measures Of glory, and felicity, and love, Surrendering the whole heart to sacred pleasures?  VIII  O Britain! dearer far than life is dear, If one there be Of all thy progeny Who can forget thy prowess, never more Be that ungrateful Son allowed to hear Thy green leaves rustle or thy torrents roar. As springs the lion from his den, As from a forest-brake Upstarts a glistering snake, The bold Arch-despot re-appeared;--again Wide Europe heaves, impatient to be cast, With all her armed Powers, On that offensive soil, like waves upon a thousand shores. The trumpet blew a universal blast! But Thou art foremost in the field:--there stand: Receive the triumph destined to thy hand! All States have glorified themselves;--their claims Are weighed by Providence, in balance even; And now, in preference to the mightiest names, To Thee the exterminating sword is given. Dread mark of approbation, justly gained! Exalted office, worthily sustained!  IX  Preserve, O Lord! within our hearts The memory of thy favour, That else insensibly departs, And loses its sweet savour! Lodge it within us!--as the power of light Lives inexhaustibly in precious gems, Fixed on the front of Eastern diadems, So shine our thankfulness for ever bright! What offering, what transcendent monument Shall our sincerity to Thee present? --Not work of hands; but trophies that may reach To highest Heaven--the labour of the Soul; That builds, as thy unerring precepts teach, Upon the internal conquests made by each, Her hope of lasting glory for the whole. Yet will not heaven disown nor earth gainsay The outward service of this day; Whether the worshippers entreat Forgiveness from God's mercy-seat; Or thanks and praises to His throne ascend That He has brought our warfare to an end, And that we need no second victory!-- Ha! what a ghastly sight for man to see; And to the heavenly saints in peace who dwell, For a brief moment, terrible; But, to thy sovereign penetration, fair, Before whom all things are, that were, All judgments that have been, or e'er shall be; Links in the chain of thy tranquillity! Along the bosom of this favoured Nation, Breathe Thou, this day, a vital undulation! Let all who do this land inherit Be conscious of thy moving spirit! Oh, 'tis a goodly Ordinance,--the sight, Though sprung from bleeding war, is one of pure delight; Bless Thou the hour, or ere the hour arrive, When a whole people shall kneel down in prayer, And, at one moment, in one rapture, strive With lip and heart to tell their gratitude For thy protecting care, Their solemn joy--praising the Eternal Lord For tyranny subdued, And for the sway of equity renewed, For liberty confirmed, and peace restored!  X  But hark--the summons!--down the placid lake Floats the soft cadence of the church-tower bells; Bright shines the Sun, as if his beams would wake The tender insects sleeping in their cells; Bright shines the Sun--and not a breeze to shake The drops that tip the melting icicles. 'O, enter now his temple gate!' Inviting words--perchance already flung (As the crowd press devoutly down the aisle Of some old Minster's venerable pile) From voices into zealous passion stung, While the tubed engine feels the inspiring blast, And has begun--its clouds of sound to cast Forth towards empyreal Heaven, As if the fretted roof were riven. 'Us', humbler ceremonies now await; But in the bosom, with devout respect The banner of our joy we will erect, And strength of love our souls shall elevate: For to a few collected in his name, Their heavenly Father will incline an ear Gracious to service hallowed by its aim;-- Awake! the majesty of God revere! Go--and with foreheads meekly bowed Present your prayers--go--and rejoice aloud-- The Holy One will hear! And what, 'mid silence deep, with faith sincere, Ye, in your low and undisturbed estate, Shall simply feel and purely meditate-- Of warnings--from the unprecedented might, Which, in our time, the impious have disclosed; And of more arduous duties thence imposed Upon the future advocates of right; Of mysteries revealed, And judgments unrepealed, Of earthly revolution, And final retribution,-- To his omniscience will appear An offering not unworthy to find place, On this high DAY of THANKS, before the Throne of Grace! \r\n                         \n", "To Lady Eleanor Butler And The Honourable Miss Ponsonby,": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        A stream to mingle with your favorite Dee Along the Vale of Meditation flows; So styled by those fierce Britons, pleased to see In Nature's face the expression of repose, Or, haply there some pious Hermit chose To live and die -- the peace of Heaven his aim, To whome the wild sequestered region owes At this late day, its sanctifying name.

One winter's night, when through the trees The wind was roaring, on his knees His youngest born did Andrew hold: And while the rest, a ruddy quire, Were seated round their blazing fire, This Tale the Shepherd told.  II  'I saw a crag, a lofty stone As ever tempest beat! Out of its head an Oak had grown, A Broom out of its feet. The time was March, a cheerful noon-- The thaw-wind, with the breath of June, Breathed gently from the warm south-west: When, in a voice sedate with age, This Oak, a giant and a sage, His neighbour thus addressed:--  III  ''Eight weary weeks, through rock and clay, Along this mountain's edge, The Frost hath wrought both night and day, Wedge driving after wedge. Look up! and think, above your head What trouble, surely, will be bred; Last night I heard a crash--'tis true, The splinters took another road-- I see them yonder--what a load For such a Thing as you!  IV  ''You are preparing as before, To deck your slender shape; And yet, just three years back--no more-- You had a strange escape: Down from yon cliff a fragment broke; It thundered down, with fire and smoke, And hitherward pursued its way; This ponderous block was caught by me, And o'er your head, as you may see, 'Tis hanging to this day!  V  ''If breeze or bird to this rough steep Your kind's first seed did bear; The breeze had better been asleep, The bird caught in a snare: For you and your green twigs decoy The little witless shepherd-boy To come and slumber in your bower; And, trust me, on some sultry noon, Both you and he, Heaven knows how soon! Will perish in one hour.  VI  ''From me this friendly warning take'-- The Broom began to doze, And thus, to keep herself awake, Did gently interpose: 'My thanks for your discourse are due; That more than what you say is true, I know, and I have known it long; Frail is the bond by which we hold Our being, whether young or old, Wise, foolish, weak, or strong.  VII  ''Disasters, do the best we can, Will reach both great and small; And he is oft the wisest man, Who is not wise at all. For me, why should I wish to roam? This spot is my paternal home, It is my pleasant heritage; My father many a happy year, Spread here his careless blossoms, here Attained a good old age.  VIII  ''Even such as his may be my lot. What cause have I to haunt My heart with terrors? Am I not In truth a favoured plant! On me such bounty Summer pours, That I am covered o'er with flowers; And, when the Frost is in the sky, My branches are so fresh and gay That you might look at me and say, This Plant can never die.  IX  ''The butterfly, all green and gold, To me hath often flown, Here in my blossoms to behold Wings lovely as his own. When grass is chill with rain or dew, Beneath my shade, the mother-ewe Lies with her infant lamb; I see The love they to each other make, And the sweet joy which they partake, It is a joy to me.'  X  'Her voice was blithe, her heart was light; The Broom might have pursued Her speech, until the stars of night Their journey had renewed; But in the branches of the oak Two ravens now began to croak Their nuptial song, a gladsome air; And to her own green bower the breeze That instant brought two stripling bees To rest, or murmur there.  XI  'One night, my Children! from the north There came a furious blast; At break of day I ventured forth, And near the cliff I passed. The storm had fallen upon the Oak, And struck him with a mighty stroke, And whirled, and whirled him far away; And, in one hospitable cleft, The little careless Broom was left To live for many a day.' \r\n                         \n", "The Pet-Lamb": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        A PASTORAL  THE dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink; I heard a voice; it said, 'Drink, pretty creature, drink!' And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied A snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.  Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone, And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone; With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel, While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.  The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took, Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook.  'Drink, pretty creature, drink,' she said in such a tone That I almost received her heart into my own.  'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare! I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair. Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away: But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.  Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady place I unobserved could see the workings of her face: If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring, Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing:   'What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord? Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board? Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be; Rest, little young One, rest; what is't that aileth thee?  'What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart? Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art: This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers; And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!  'If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain, This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain;  For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need'st not fear, The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.  'Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the day When my father found thee first in places far away; Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none, And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.  'He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home: A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam? A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean Upon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been.   'Thou know'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this can Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran; And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew, I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.  'Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now, Then I'll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough; My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is cold Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.  'It will not, will not rest!--Poor creature, can it be That 'tis thy mother's heart which is working so in thee?  Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear, And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear.  'Alas, the mountain-tops that look so green and fair! I've heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there; The little brooks that seem all pastime and all play, When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey.  'Here thou need'st not dread the raven in the sky; Night and day thou art safe,--our cottage is hard by. Why bleat so after me? Why pull so at thy chain? Sleep--and at break of day I will come to thee again!'   --As homeward through the lane I went with lazy feet, This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat; And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line, That but half of it was hers, and one half of it was 'mine'.  Again, and once again, did I repeat the song; 'Nay,' said I, 'more than half to the damsel must belong, For she looked with such a look and she spake with such a tone, That I almost received her heart into my own.' \r\n                         \n", "To The Small Celandine": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        PANSIES, lilies, kingcups, daisies, Let them live upon their praises; Long as there's a sun that sets, Primroses will have their glory; Long as there are violets, They will have a place in story: There's a flower that shall be mine, 'Tis the little Celandine.

And, if a thought of dying, if a thought Of mortal separation, could intrude With paradise before him, here to die!' No Prophet was he, had not even a hope, Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought, A fancy in the heart of what might be The lot of others, never could be his. The station whence he looked was soft and green, Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth  Of vale below, a height of hills above. For rest of body perfect was the spot, All that luxurious nature could desire; But stirring to the spirit; who could gaze And not feel motions there? He thought of clouds That sail on winds: of breezes that delight To play on water, or in endless chase Pursue each other through the yielding plain Of grass or corn, over and through and through, In billow after billow, evermore  Disporting--nor unmindful was the boy Of sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds; Of fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays, Genii, and winged angels that are Lords Without restraint of all which they behold. The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he felt That such unfettered liberty was his, Such power and joy; but only for this end, To flit from field to rock, from rock to field, From shore to island, and from isle to shore,  From open ground to covert, from a bed Of meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood; From high to low, from low to high, yet still Within the bound of this huge concave; here Must be his home, this valley be his world. Since that day forth the Place to him--'to me' (For I who live to register the truth Was that same young and happy Being) became As beautiful to thought, as it had been When present, to the bodily sense; a haunt  Of pure affections, shedding upon joy A brighter joy; and through such damp and gloom Of the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youth Mistakes for sorrow, darting beams of light That no self-cherished sadness could withstand; And now 'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale, Beloved Grasmere (let the wandering streams Take up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name) One of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home. And was the cost so great? and could it seem  An act of courage, and the thing itself A conquest? who must bear the blame? Sage man Thy prudence, thy experience, thy desires, Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all. Yes the realities of life so cold, So cowardly, so ready to betray, So stinted in the measure of their grace As we pronounce them, doing them much wrong, Have been to me more bountiful than hope, Less timid than desire--but that is past.  On Nature's invitation do I come, By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead, That made the calmest fairest spot of earth With all its unappropriated good My own; and not mine only, for with me Entrenched, say rather peacefully embowered, Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot, A younger Orphan of a home extinct, The only Daughter of my Parents dwells. Ay, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir,  Pause upon that and let the breathing frame No longer breathe, but all be satisfied. --Oh, if such silence be not thanks to God For what hath been bestowed, then where, where then Shall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne'er Fix on a lovely object, nor my mind Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts, But either She whom now I have, who now Divides with me this loved abode, was there, Or not far off. Where'er my footsteps turned,  Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang, The thought of her was like a flash of light, Or an unseen companionship, a breath Of fragrance independent of the Wind. In all my goings, in the new and old Of all my meditations, and in this Favourite of all, in this the most of all. --What being, therefore, since the birth of Man Had ever more abundant cause to speak Thanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse  Make him more thankful, then to call on Verse To aid him and in song resound his joy? The boon is absolute; surpassing grace To me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowers Of blissful Eden this was neither given Nor could be given, possession of the good Which had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled, And dear Imaginations realised, Up to their highest measure, yea and more. Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in;  Now in the clear and open day I feel Your guardianship; I take it to my heart; 'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night. But I would call thee beautiful, for mild, And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou art Dear Valley, having in thy face a smile Though peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased, Pleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake, Its one green island and its winding shores; The multitude of little rocky hills,  Thy Church and cottages of mountain stone Clustered like stars some few, but single most, And lurking dimly in their shy retreats, Or glancing at each other cheerful looks Like separated stars with clouds between. What want we? have we not perpetual streams, Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields, And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds, And thickets full of songsters, and the voice Of lordly birds, an unexpected sound  Heard now and then from morn to latest eve, Admonishing the man who walks below Of solitude and silence in the sky? These have we, and a thousand nooks of earth Have also these, but nowhere else is found, Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be found The one sensation that is here; 'tis here, Here as it found its way into my heart In childhood, here as it abides by day, By night, here only; or in chosen minds  That take it with them hence, where'er they go. --'Tis, but I cannot name it, 'tis the sense Of majesty, and beauty, and repose, A blended holiness of earth and sky, Something that makes this individual spot, This small abiding-place of many men, A termination, and a last retreat, A centre, come from wheresoe'er you will, A whole without dependence or defect, Made for itself, and happy in itself,  Perfect contentment, Unity entire. Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak, When hitherward we journeyed side by side Through burst of sunshine and through flying showers; Paced the long vales--how long they were--and yet How fast that length of way was left behind, Wensley's rich Vale, and Sedbergh's naked heights. The frosty wind, as if to make amends For its keen breath, was aiding to our steps, And drove us onward like two ships at sea,  Or like two birds, companions in mid-air, Parted and reunited by the blast. Stern was the face of nature; we rejoiced In that stern countenance, for our souls thence drew A feeling of their strength. The naked trees, The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared To question us. 'Whence come ye, to what end?' They seemed to say, 'What would ye,' said the shower, 'Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?' The sunbeam said, 'Be happy.' When this vale  We entered, bright and solemn was the sky That faced us with a passionate welcoming, And led us to our threshold. Daylight failed Insensibly, and round us gently fell Composing darkness, with a quiet load Of full contentment, in a little shed Disturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed, And wondering at its new inhabitants. It loves us now, this Vale so beautiful Begins to love us! by a sullen storm,  Two months unwearied of severest storm, It put the temper of our minds to proof, And found us faithful through the gloom, and heard The poet mutter his prelusive songs With cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joy Among the silence of the woods and hills; Silent to any gladsomeness of sound With all their shepherds. But the gates of Spring Are opened; churlish winter hath given leave That she should entertain for this one day,  Perhaps for many genial days to come, His guests, and make them jocund.--They are pleased, But most of all the birds that haunt the flood With the mild summons; inmates though they be Of Winter's household, they keep festival This day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long; They show their pleasure, and shall I do less? Happier of happy though I be, like them I cannot take possession of the sky, Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there  One of a mighty multitude, whose way Is a perpetual harmony and dance Magnificent. Behold how with a grace Of ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seem Inferior to angelical, they prolong Their curious pastime, shaping in mid-air, And sometimes with ambitious wing that soars High as the level of the mountain tops, A circuit ampler than the lake beneath, Their own domain;--but ever, while intent  On tracing and retracing that large round, Their jubilant activity evolves Hundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro, Upwards and downwards; progress intricate Yet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayed Their indefatigable flight. 'Tis done, Ten times and more I fancied it had ceased, But lo! the vanished company again Ascending, they approach. I hear their wings Faint, faint at first; and then an eager sound  Passed in a moment--and as faint again! They tempt the sun to sport among their plumes; Tempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice, To show them a fair image,--'tis themselves, Their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain Painted more soft and fair as they descend, Almost to touch,--then up again aloft, Up with a sally and a flash of speed, As if they scorned both resting-place and rest! --This day is a thanksgiving, 'tis a day  Of glad emotion and deep quietness; Not upon me alone hath been bestowed, Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts, The penetrating bliss; oh surely these Have felt it, not the happy choirs of spring, Her own peculiar family of love That sport among green leaves, a blither train! But two are missing, two, a lonely pair Of milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seen Partaking this day's pleasure? From afar  They came, to sojourn here in solitude, Choosing this Valley, they who had the choice Of the whole world. We saw them day by day, Through those two months of unrelenting storm, Conspicuous at the centre of the Lake Their safe retreat, we knew them well, I guess That the whole valley knew them; but to us They were more dear than may be well believed, Not only for their beauty, and their still And placid way of life, and constant love  Inseparable, not for these alone, But that 'their' state so much resembled ours, They having also chosen this abode; They strangers, and we strangers, they a pair, And we a solitary pair like them. They should not have departed; many days Did I look forth in vain, nor on the wing Could see them, nor in that small open space Of blue unfrozen water, where they lodged And lived so long in quiet, side by side.  Shall we behold them consecrated friends, Faithful companions, yet another year Surviving, they for us, and we for them, And neither pair be broken? nay perchance It is too late already for such hope; The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube, And parted them; or haply both are gone One death, and that were mercy given to both. Recall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive, Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh  Of such inhospitable penalty Inflicted upon confidence so pure. Ah! if I wished to follow where the sight Of all that is before my eyes, the voice Which speaks from a presiding spirit here, Would lead me, I should whisper to myself: They who are dwellers in this holy place Must needs themselves be hallowed, they require No benediction from the stranger's lips, For they are blessed already; none would give  The greeting 'peace be with you' unto them, For peace they have; it cannot but be theirs, And mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these-- 'Their' healing offices a pure good-will Precludes, and charity beyond the bounds Of charity--an overflowing love; Not for the creature only, but for all That is around them; love for everything Which in their happy Region they behold! Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought  Is passed, we blame it not for having come. --What if I floated down a pleasant stream, And now am landed, and the motion gone, Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the stream Is flowing, and will never cease to flow, And I shall float upon that stream again. By such forgetfulness the soul becomes, Words cannot say how beautiful: then hail, Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee, Delightful Valley, habitation fair!  And to whatever else of outward form Can give an inward help, can purify, And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe, And steal away, and for a while deceive And lap in pleasing rest, and bear us on Without desire in full complacency, Contemplating perfection absolute, And entertained as in a placid sleep. But not betrayed by tenderness of mind That feared, or wholly overlooked the truth,  Did we come hither, with romantic hope To find in midst of so much loveliness Love, perfect love: of so much majesty A like majestic-frame of mind in those Who here abide, the persons like the place. Not from such hope, or aught of such belief, Hath issued any portion of the joy Which I have felt this day. An awful voice 'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard, Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields,  Shout after shout--reiterated whoop, In manner of a bird that takes delight In answering to itself: or like a hound Single at chase among the lonely woods, His yell repeating; yet it was in truth A human voice--a spirit of coming night; How solemn when the sky is dark, and earth Not dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snow Made visible, amid a noise of winds And bleatings manifold of mountain sheep,  Which in that iteration recognise Their summons, and are gathering round for food, Devoured with keenness, ere to grove or bank Or rocky bield with patience they retire. That very voice, which, in some timid mood Of superstitious fancy, might have seemed Awful as ever stray demoniac uttered, His steps to govern in the wilderness; Or as the Norman Curfew's regular beat To hearths when first they darkened at the knell:  That shepherd's voice, it may have reached mine ear Debased and under profanation, made The ready organ of articulate sounds From ribaldry, impiety, or wrath, Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawls Of some abused Festivity--so be it. I came not dreaming of unruffled life, Untainted manners; born among the hills, Bred also there, I wanted not a scale To regulate my hopes; pleased with the good  I shrink not from the evil with disgust, Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man, The common creature of the brotherhood, Differing but little from the Man elsewhere, For selfishness and envy and revenge, Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be-- Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong. Yet is it something gained, it is in truth A mighty gain, that Labour here preserves His rosy face, a servant only here  Of the fireside or of the open field, A Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired: That extreme penury is here unknown, And cold and hunger's abject wretchedness Mortal to body and the heaven-born mind: That they who want are not too great a weight For those who can relieve; here may the heart Breathe in the air of fellow-suffering Dreadless, as in a kind of fresher breeze Of her own native element, the hand  Be ready and unwearied without plea, From tasks too frequent or beyond its power, For languor or indifference or despair. And as these lofty barriers break the force Of winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in part Conceal us from the storm, so here abides A power and a protection for the mind, Dispensed indeed to other solitudes Favoured by noble privilege like this, Where kindred independence of estate  Is prevalent, where he who tills the field, He, happy man! is master of the field, And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod. Not less than halfway up yon mountain's side, Behold a dusky spot, a grove of Firs That seems still smaller than it is; this grove Is haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spirit Of memory faithful to the call of love; For, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends up Yon curling smoke from the grey cot below,  The trees (her first-born child being then a babe) Were planted by her husband and herself, That ranging o'er the high and houseless ground Their sheep might neither want from perilous storm Of winter, nor from summer's sultry heat, A friendly covert; 'and they knew it well,' Said she, 'for thither as the trees grew up We to the patient creatures carried food In times of heavy snow.' She then began In fond obedience to her private thoughts  To speak of her dead husband; is there not An art, a music, and a strain of words That shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life, Shall speak of what is done among the fields, Done truly there, or felt, of solid good And real evil, yet be sweet withal, More grateful, more harmonious than the breath, The idle breath of softest pipe attuned To pastoral fancies? Is there such a stream Pure and unsullied flowing from the heart  With motions of true dignity and grace? Or must we seek that stream where Man is not? Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse, Delicious as the gentlest breeze that sounds Through that aerial fir-grove--could preserve Some portion of its human history As gathered from the Matron's lips, and tell Of tears that have been shed at sight of it, And moving dialogues between this Pair Who in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands  Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while they No longer flourish, he entirely gone, She withering in her loneliness. Be this A task above my skill--the silent mind Has her own treasures, and I think of these, Love what I see, and honour humankind. No, we are not alone, we do not stand, My sister here misplaced and desolate, Loving what no one cares for but ourselves, We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks  Of this fair Vale, and o'er its spacious heights, Unprofitable kindliness, bestowed On objects unaccustomed to the gifts Of feeling, which were cheerless and forlorn But few weeks past, and would be so again Were we not here; we do not tend a lamp Whose lustre we alone participate, Which shines dependent upon us alone, Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame. Look where we will, some human hand has been  Before us with its offering; not a tree Sprinkles these little pastures, but the same Hath furnished matter for a thought; perchance For some one serves as a familiar friend. Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale, Home of untutored shepherds as it is, Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine, Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deem These feelings, though subservient more than ours To every day's demand for daily bread,  And borrowing more their spirit and their shape From self-respecting interests; deem them not Unworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no, They lift the animal being, do themselves By nature's kind and ever-present aid Refine the selfishness from which they spring, Redeem by love the individual sense Of anxiousness, with which they are combined. And thus it is that fitly they become Associates in the joy of purest minds:  They blend therewith congenially: meanwhile Calmly they breathe their own undying life Through this their mountain sanctuary; long Oh long may it remain inviolate, Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness, And giving to the moments as they pass Their little boons of animating thought That sweeten labour, make it seen and felt To be no arbitrary weight imposed, But a glad function natural to man.  Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be, Already have I gained; the inward frame, Though slowly opening, opens every day With process not unlike to that which cheers A pensive stranger journeying at his leisure Through some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mists Break up and are beginning to recede; How pleased he is where thin and thinner grows The veil, or where it parts at once, to spy The dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads;  To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed; Then to be greeted by the scattered huts As they shine out; and 'see' the streams whose murmur Had soothed his ear while 'they' were hidden; how pleased To have about him which way e'er he goes Something on every side concealed from view, In every quarter something visible Half seen or wholly, lost and found again, Alternate progress and impediment, And yet a growing prospect in the main.  Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced, Herein less happy than the Traveller, To cast from time to time a painful look Upon unwelcome things which unawares Reveal themselves, not therefore is my heart Depressed, nor does it fear what is to come; But confident, enriched at every glance, The more I see the more delight my mind Receives, or by reflection can create: Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells  With Hope, who would not follow where she leads? Nor let me pass unheeded other loves Where no fear is, and humbler sympathies. Already hath sprung up within my heart A liking for the small grey horse that bears The paralytic man, and for the brute In Scripture sanctified--the patient brute On which the cripple, in the quarry maimed, Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways. The famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale,  Though yet to me a stranger, will not be A stranger long; nor will the blind man's guide, Meek and neglected thing, of no renown! Soon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fades Friends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrush To rouse me, and a hundred warblers more! And if those Eagles to their ancient hold Return, Helvellyn's Eagles! with the Pair From my own door I shall be free to claim Acquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud.  The owl that gives the name to Owlet-Crag Have I heard whooping, and he soon will be A chosen one of my regards. See there The heifer in yon little croft belongs To one who holds it dear; with duteous care She reared it, and in speaking of her charge I heard her scatter some endearing words Domestic, and in spirit motherly, She being herself a mother; happy Beast, If the caresses of a human voice  Can make it so, and care of human hands. And ye as happy under Nature's care, Strangers to me and all men, or at least Strangers to all particular amity, All intercourse of knowledge or of love That parts the individual from his kind. Whether in large communities ye keep From year to year, not shunning man's abode, A settled residence, or be from far Wild creatures, and of many homes, that come  The gift of winds, and whom the winds again Take from us at your pleasure; yet shall ye Not want for this your own subordinate place In my affections. Witness the delight With which erewhile I saw that multitude Wheel through the sky, and see them now at rest, Yet not at rest upon the glassy lake: They 'cannot' rest--they gambol like young whelps; Active as lambs, and overcome with joy They try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge,  And beat the passive water with their wings. Too distant are they for plain view, but lo! Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun, Betray their occupation, rising up First one and then another silver spout, As one or other takes the fit of glee, Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guise Of plaything fireworks, that on festal nights Sparkle about the feet of wanton boys. --How vast the compass of this theatre,  Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pomp And silent majesty; the birch-tree woods Are hung with thousand thousand diamond drops Of melted hoar-frost, every tiny knot In the bare twigs, each little budding-place Cased with its several beads; what myriads these Upon one tree, while all the distant grove, That rises to the summit of the steep, Shows like a mountain built of silver light: See yonder the same pageant, and again  Behold the universal imagery Inverted, all its sun-bright features touched As with the varnish and the gloss of dreams. Dreamlike the blending also of the whole Harmonious landscape: all along the shore The boundary lost--the line invisible That parts the image from reality; And the clear hills, as high as they ascend Heavenward, so deep piercing the lake below. Admonished of the days of love to come  The raven croaks, and fills the upper air With a strange sound of genial harmony; And in and all about that playful band, Incapable although they be of rest, And in their fashion very rioters, There is a stillness, and they seem to make Calm revelry in that their calm abode. Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass, Pass with a thought the life of the whole year That is to come: the throng of woodland flowers  And lilies that will dance upon the waves. Say boldly then that solitude is not Where these things are: he truly is alone, He of the multitude whose eyes are doomed To hold a vacant commerce day by day With Objects wanting life--repelling love; He by the vast metropolis immured, Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls, Where numbers overwhelm humanity, And neighbourhood serves rather to divide  Than to unite--what sighs more deep than his, Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed; Who must inhabit under a black sky A city, where, if indifference to disgust Yield not to scorn or sorrow, living men Are ofttimes to their fellow-men no more Than to the forest Hermit are the leaves That hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less, For they protect his walk from sun and shower, Swell his devotion with their voice in storms,  And whisper while the stars twinkle among them His lullaby. From crowded streets remote, Far from the living and dead Wilderness Of the thronged world, Society is here A true community--a genuine frame Of many into one incorporate. 'That' must be looked for here: paternal sway, One household, under God, for high and low, One family and one mansion; to themselves Appropriate, and divided from the world,  As if it were a cave, a multitude Human and brute, possessors undisturbed Of this Recess--their legislative Hall, Their Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place. Dismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams, All golden fancies of the golden age, The bright array of shadowy thoughts from times That were before all time, or are to be Ere time expire, the pageantry that stirs Or will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed  On lovely objects, and we wish to part With all remembrance of a jarring world, --Take we at once this one sufficient hope, What need of more? that we shall neither droop Nor pine for want of pleasure in the life Scattered about us, nor through want of aught That keeps in health the insatiable mind. --That we shall have for knowledge and for love Abundance, and that feeling as we do How goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure  From all reproach is yon ethereal vault, And this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart, By which and under which we are enclosed To breathe in peace; we shall moreover find (If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves, If rightly we observe and justly weigh) The inmates not unworthy of their home, The Dwellers of their Dwelling. And if this Were otherwise, we have within ourselves Enough to fill the present day with joy,  And overspread the future years with hope, Our beautiful and quiet home, enriched Already with a stranger whom we love Deeply, a stranger of our Father's house, A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea, Who finds at last an hour to his content Beneath our roof. And others whom we love Will seek us also, Sisters of our hearts, And one, like them, a Brother of our hearts, Philosopher and Poet, in whose sight  These mountains will rejoice with open joy. --Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we are And must be, with God's will, a happy Band. Yet 'tis not to enjoy that we exist, For that end only; something must be done: I must not walk in unreproved delight These narrow bounds, and think of nothing more, No duty that looks further, and no care. Each Being has his office, lowly some And common, yet all worthy if fulfilled  With zeal, acknowledgment that with the gift Keeps pace a harvest answering to the seed. Of ill-advised Ambition and of Pride I would stand clear, but yet to me I feel That an internal brightness is vouchsafed That must not die, that must not pass away. Why does this inward lustre fondly seek And gladly blend with outward fellowship? Why do 'they' shine around me whom I love? Why do they teach me, whom I thus revere?  Strange question, yet it answers not itself. That humble Roof embowered among the trees, That calm fireside, it is not even in them, Blest as they are, to furnish a reply That satisfies and ends in perfect rest. Possessions have I that are solely mine, Something within which yet is shared by none, Not even the nearest to me and most dear, Something which power and effort may impart; I would impart it, I would spread it wide:  Immortal in the world which is to come-- Forgive me if I add another claim-- And would not wholly perish even in this, Lie down and be forgotten in the dust, I and the modest Partners of my days Making a silent company in death; Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights, All buried with me without monument Or profit unto any but ourselves! It must not be, if I, divinely taught,  Be privileged to speak as I have felt Of what in man is human or divine. While yet an innocent little one, with a heart That doubtless wanted not its tender moods, I breathed (for this I better recollect) Among wild appetites and blind desires, Motions of savage instinct my delight And exaltation. Nothing at that time So welcome, no temptation half so dear As that which urged me to a daring feat,  Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags, And tottering towers: I loved to stand and read Their looks forbidding, read and disobey, Sometimes in act and evermore in thought. With impulses, that scarcely were by these Surpassed in strength, I heard of danger met Or sought with courage; enterprise forlorn By one, sole keeper of his own intent, Or by a resolute few, who for the sake Of glory fronted multitudes in arms.  Yea, to this hour I cannot read a Tale Of two brave vessels matched in deadly fight, And fighting to the death, but I am pleased More than a wise man ought to be; I wish, Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there. But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seek For other agitations, or be calm; Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream, Some nursling of the mountains which she leads Through quiet meadows, after he has learnt  His strength, and had his triumph and his joy, His desperate course of tumult and of glee. That which in stealth by Nature was performed Hath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate Voice Hath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things, Thy glory and thy happiness be there. Nor fear, though thou confide in me, a want Of aspirations that have been--of foes To wrestle with, and victory to complete, Bounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored;  All that inflamed thy infant heart, the love, The longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest, All shall survive, though changed their office, all Shall live, it is not in their power to die. Then farewell to the Warrior's Schemes, farewell The forwardness of soul which looks that way Upon a less incitement than the Cause Of Liberty endangered, and farewell That other hope, long mine, the hope to fill The heroic trumpet with the Muse's breath!  Yet in this peaceful Vale we will not spend Unheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought, A voice shall speak, and what will be the theme? On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life, Musing in solitude, I oft perceive Fair trains of imagery before me rise, Accompanied by feelings of delight Pure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed; And I am conscious of affecting thoughts And dear remembrances, whose presence soothes  Or elevates the Mind, intent to weigh The good and evil of our mortal state. --To these emotions, whencesoe'er they come, Whether from breath of outward circumstance, Or from the Soul--an impulse to herself-- I would give utterance in numerous verse. Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope, And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith; Of blessed consolations in distress; Of moral strength, and intellectual Power;  Of joy in widest commonalty spread; Of the individual Mind that keeps her own Inviolate retirement, subject there To Conscience only, and the law supreme Of that Intelligence which governs all-- I sing:--'fit audience let me find though few!' So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard-- In holiest mood. Urania, I shall need Thy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such Descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!  For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink Deep--and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil. All strength--all terror, single or in bands, That ever was put forth in personal form-- Jehovah--with his thunder, and the choir Of shouting Angels, and the empyreal thrones-- I pass them unalarmed. Not Chaos, not The darkest pit of lowest Erebus, Nor aught of blinder vacancy, scooped out  By help of dreams--can breed such fear and awe As fall upon us often when we look Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man-- My haunt, and the main region of my song --Beauty--a living Presence of the earth, Surpassing the most fair ideal Forms Which craft of delicate Spirits hath composed From earth's materials--waits upon my steps; Pitches her tents before me as I move, An hourly neighbour. Paradise, and groves  Elysian, Fortunate Fields--like those of old Sought in the Atlantic Main--why should they be A history only of departed things, Or a mere fiction of what never was? For the discerning intellect of Man, When wedded to this goodly universe In love and holy passion, shall find these A simple produce of the common day. --I, long before the blissful hour arrives, Would chant, in lonely peace, the spousal verse  Of this great consummation:--and, by words Which speak of nothing more than what we are, Would I arouse the sensual from their sleep Of Death, and win the vacant and the vain To noble raptures; while my voice proclaims How exquisitely the individual Mind (And the progressive powers perhaps no less Of the whole species) to the external World Is fitted:--and how exquisitely, too-- Theme this but little heard of among men--  The external World is fitted to the Mind; And the creation (by no lower name Can it be called) which they with blended might Accomplish:--this is our high argument. --Such grateful haunts foregoing, if I oft Must turn elsewhere--to travel near the tribes And fellowships of men, and see ill sights Of madding passions mutually inflamed; Must hear Humanity in fields and groves Pipe solitary anguish; or must hang  Brooding above the fierce confederate storm Of sorrow, barricadoed evermore Within the walls of cities--may these sounds Have their authentic comment; that even these Hearing, I be not downcast or forlorn!-- Descend, prophetic Spirit! that inspir'st The human Soul of universal earth, Dreaming on things to come; and dost possess A metropolitan temple in the hearts Of mighty Poets; upon me bestow  A gift of genuine insight; that my Song With star-like virtue in its place may shine, Shedding benignant influence, and secure Itself from all malevolent effect Of those mutations that extend their sway Throughout the nether sphere!--And if with this I mix more lowly matter; with the thing Contemplated, describe the Mind and Man Contemplating; and who, and what he was-- The transitory Being that beheld  This Vision;--when and where, and how he lived; Be not this labour useless. If such theme May sort with highest objects, then--dread Power! Whose gracious favour is the primal source Of all illumination--may my Life Express the image of a better time, More wise desires, and simpler manners;--nurse My Heart in genuine freedom:--all pure thoughts Be with me;--so shall thy unfailing love Guide, and support, and cheer me to the end! \r\n                         \n", "To The Spade Of A Friend (An Agriculturist)": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        COMPOSED WHILE WE WERE LABOURING TOGETHER IN HIS PLEASURE-GROUND  SPADE! with which Wilkinson hath tilled his lands, And shaped these pleasant walks by Emont's side, Thou art a tool of honour in my hands; I press thee, through the yielding soil, with pride.  Rare master has it been thy lot to know; Long hast Thou served a man to reason true; Whose life combines the best of high and low, The labouring many and the resting few;  Health, meekness, ardour, quietness secure, And industry of body and of mind;  And elegant enjoyments, that are pure As nature is; too pure to be refined.  Here often hast Thou heard the Poet sing In concord with his river murmuring by; Or in some silent field, while timid spring Is yet uncheered by other minstrelsy.  Who shall inherit Thee when death has laid Low in the darksome cell thine own dear lord? That man will have a trophy, humble Spade! A trophy nobler than a conqueror's sword.   If he be one that feels, with skill to part False praise from true, or, greater from the less, Thee will he welcome to his hand and heart, Thou monument of peaceful happiness!  He will not dread with Thee a toilsome day-- Thee his loved servant, his inspiring mate! And, when thou art past service, worn away, No dull oblivious nook shall hide thy fate.  His thrift thy uselessness will never scorn; An 'heir-loom' in his cottage wilt thou be:--  High will he hang thee up, well pleased to adorn His rustic chimney with the last of Thee! \r\n                         \n", "The Waggoner  -  Canto Third": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        RIGHT gladly had the horses stirred, When they the wished-for greeting heard, The whip's loud notice from the door, That they were free to move once more. You think, those doings must have bred In them disheartening doubts and dread; No, not a horse of all the eight,  Although it be a moonless night, Fears either for himself or freight; For this they know (and let it hide, In part, the offences of their guide) That Benjamin, with clouded brains, Is worth the best with all their pains; And, if they had a prayer to make, The prayer would be that they may take With him whatever comes in course, The better fortune or the worse;  That no one else may have business near them, And, drunk or sober, he may steer them. So, forth in dauntless mood they fare, And with them goes the guardian pair. Now, heroes, for the true commotion, The triumph of your late devotion Can aught on earth impede delight, Still mounting to a higher height; And higher still--a greedy flight! Can any low-born care pursue her,  Can any mortal clog come to her? No notion have they--not a thought, That is from joyless regions brought! And, while they coast the silent lake, Their inspiration I partake; Share their empyreal spirits--yea, With their enraptured vision, see-- O fancy--what a jubilee! What shifting pictures--clad in gleams Of colour bright as feverish dreams!  Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene, Involved and restless all--a scene Pregnant with mutual exaltation, Rich change, and multiplied creation! This sight to me the Muse imparts;-- And then, what kindness in their hearts! What tears of rapture, what vow-making, Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking! What solemn, vacant, interlacing, As if they'd fall asleep embracing!  Then, in the turbulence of glee, And in the excess of amity, Says Benjamin, 'That Ass of thine, He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine: If he were tethered to the waggon, He'd drag as well what he is dragging, And we, as brother should with brother, Might trudge it alongside each other!' Forthwith, obedient to command, The horses made a quiet stand;  And to the waggon's skirts was tied The Creature, by the Mastiff's side, The Mastiff wondering, and perplext With dread of what will happen next; And thinking it but sorry cheer, To have such company so near! This new arrangement made, the Wain Through the still night proceeds again; No Moon hath risen her light to lend; But indistinctly may be kenned  The VANGUARD, following close behind, Sails spread, as if to catch the wind! 'Thy wife and child are snug and warm, Thy ship will travel without harm; I like,' said Benjamin, 'her shape and stature: And this of mine--this bulky creature Of which I have the steering--this, Seen fairly, is not much amiss! We want your streamers, friend, you know; But, altogether as we go,  We make a kind of handsome show! Among these hills, from first to last, We've weathered many a furious blast; Hard passage forcing on, with head Against the storm, and canvas spread. I hate a boaster; but to thee Will say't, who know'st both land and sea, The unluckiest hulk that stems the brine Is hardly worse beset than mine, When cross-winds on her quarter beat;  And, fairly lifted from my feet, I stagger onward--heaven knows how; But not so pleasantly as now: Poor pilot I, by snows confounded, And many a foundrous pit surrounded! Yet here we are, by night and day Grinding through rough and smooth our way; Through foul and fair our task fulfilling; And long shall be so yet--God willing!' 'Ay,' said the Tar, 'through fair and foul--  But save us from yon screeching owl!' That instant was begun a fray Which called their thoughts another way: The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl! What must he do but growl and snarl, Still more and more dissatisfied With the meek comrade at his side! Till, not incensed though put to proof, The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof, Salutes the Mastiff on the head;  And so were better manners bred, And all was calmed and quieted. 'Yon screech-owl,' says the Sailor, turning Back to his former cause of mourning, 'Yon owl!--pray God that all be well! 'Tis worse than any funeral bell; As sure as I've the gift of sight, We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!' --Said Benjamin, 'This whip shall lay A thousand, if they cross our way.  I know that Wanton's noisy station, I know him and his occupation; The jolly bird hath learned his cheer Upon the banks of Windermere; Where a tribe of them make merry, Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry; Hallooing from an open throat, Like travellers shouting for a boat. --The tricks he learned at Windermere This vagrant owl is playing here--  That is the worst of his employment: He's at the top of his enjoyment!' This explanation stilled the alarm, Cured the foreboder like a charm; This, and the manner, and the voice, Summoned the Sailor to rejoice; His heart is up--he fears no evil From life or death, from man or devil; He wheels--and, making many stops, Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops;  And, while he talked of blows and scars, Benjamin, among the stars, Beheld a dancing--and a glancing; Such retreating and advancing As, I ween, was never seen In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars! \r\n                         \n", "To The Memory Of Raisley Calvert": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        CALVERT! it must not be unheard by them Who may respect my name, that I to thee Owed many years of early liberty. This care was thine when sickness did condemn Thy youth to hopeless wasting, root and stem-- That I, if frugal and severe, might stray Where'er I liked; and finally array My temples with the Muse's diadem. Hence, if in freedom I have loved the truth; If there be aught of pure, or good, or great,  In my past verse; or shall be, in the lays Of higher mood, which now I meditate;-- It gladdens me, O worthy, short-lived, Youth! To think how much of this will be thy praise. \r\n                         \n"}
