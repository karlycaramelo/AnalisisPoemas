{"The Appeal": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        It I have given you delight By aught that I have done, Let me lie quiet in that night  Which shall be yours anon:  And for the little, little, span The dead are born in mind, Seek not to question other than The books I leave behind. \r\n                         \n", "The Comforters": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Until thy feet have trod the Road Advise not wayside folk, Nor till thy back has borne the Load Break in upon the broke.  Chase not with undesired largesse Of sympathy the heart Which, knowing her own bitterness, Presumes to dwell apart.  Employ not that glad hand to raise The God-forgotten head To Heaven and all the neighbours' gaze-- Cover thy mouth instead.  The quivering chin, the bitten lip, The cold and sweating brow, Later may yearn for fellowship-- Not now, you ass, not now!  Time, not thy ne'er so timely speech, Life, not thy views thereon, Shall furnish or deny to each His consolation.  Or, if impelled to interfere Exhort, uplift, advise, Lend not a base, betraying ear To all the victim's cries.  Only the Lord can understand When those first pangs begin, How much is reflex action and How much is really sin.  E'en from good words thyself refrain, And tremblingly admit There is no anodyne for pain Except the shock of it.  So, when thine own dark hour shall fall, Unchallenged canst thou say: \"I never worried you at all, For God's sake go away!\" \r\n                         \n", "The Legend Of Mirth": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        The Four Archangels, so the legends tell, Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, Azrael, Being first of those to whom the Power was shown Stood first of all the Host before The Throne, And, when the Charges were allotted, burst Tumultuous-winged from out the assembly first. Zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed Their own high judgment on their lightest deed. Zeal was their spur that, when relief was given, Urged them unwearied to new toils in Heaven;  For Honour's sake perfecting every task Beyond what e 'en Perfection's self could ask. . . And Allah, Who created Zeal and Pride, Knows how the twain are perilous-near allied.   It chanced on one of Heaven's long-lighted days, The Four and all the Host being gone their ways Each to his Charge, the shining Courts were void Save for one Seraph whom no charge employed, With folden wings and slumber-threatened brow, To whom The Word: \"Beloved, what dost thou?\" \"By the Permission,\" came the answer soft, Little I do nor do that little oft. As is The Will in Heaven so on Earth Where by The Will I strive to make men mirth\" He ceased and sped, hearing The Word once more: \" Beloved, go thy way and greet the Four.\"  Systems and Universes overpast, The Seraph came upon the Four, at last, Guiding and guarding with devoted mind The tedious generations of mankind Who lent at most unwilling ear and eye When they could not escape the ministry. . . . Yet, patient, faithful, firm, persistent, just Toward all that gross, indifferent, facile dust, The Archangels laboured to discharge their trust By precept and example, prayer and law, Advice, reproof, and rule, but, labouring, saw Each in his fellows' countenance confessed, The Doubt that sickens: \"Have I done my best?\"  Even as they sighed and turned to toil anew, The Seraph hailed them with observance due; And, after some fit talk of higher things, Touched tentative on mundane happenings. This they permitting, he, emboldened thus, Prolused of humankind promiscuous, And, since the large contention less avails Than instances observed, he told them tales-- Tales of the shop, the bed, the court, the street, Intimate, elemental, indiscreet: Occasions where Confusion smiting swift Piles jest on jest as snow-slides pile the drift Whence, one by one, beneath derisive skies, The victims' bare, bewildered heads arise-- Tales of the passing of the spirit, graced With humour blinding as the doom it faced-- Stark tales of ribaldy that broke aside To tears, by laughter swallowed ere they dried- Tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue, But Only (Allah be exalted!) true, And only, as the Seraph showed that night, Delighting to the limits of delight.   These he rehearsed with artful pause and halt, And such pretence of memory at fault, That soon the Four--so well the bait was thrown-- Came to his aid with memories of their own-- Matters dismissed long since as small or vain, Whereof the high significance had lain Hid, till the ungirt glosses made it plain. Then, as enlightenment came broad and fast, Each marvelled at his own oblivious past Until--the Gates of Laughter opened wide-- The Four, with that bland Seraph at their side, While they recalled, compared, and amplified, In utter mirth forgot both Zeal and Pride!   High over Heaven the lamps of midnight burned Ere, weak with merriment, the Four returned, Not in that order they were wont to keep-- Pinion to pinion answering, sweep for sweep, In awful diapason heard afar-- But shoutingly adrift 'twixt star and star; Reeling a planet's orbit left or right As laughter took them in the abysmal Night; Or, by the point of some remembered jest, Winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed, Where the blank worlds that gather to the birth Leaped in the Womb of Darkness at their mirth, And e'en Gehenna's bondsmen understood. They were not damned from human brotherhood . . .  Not first nor last of Heaven's high Host, the Four That night took place beneath The Throne once more. 0 lovelier than their morning majesty, The understanding light behind the eye! 0 more compelling than their old command, The new-learned friendly gesture of the hand! 0 sweeter than their zealous fellowship, The wise half-smile that passed from lip to lip! 0 well and roundly, when Command was given, They told their tale against themselves to Heaven, And in the silence, waiting on The Word, Received the Peace and Pardon of The Lord! \r\n                         \n", "The Mare's Nest": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Jane Austen Beecher Stowe de Rouse Was good beyond all earthly need; But, on the other hand, her spouse Was very, very bad indeed. He smoked cigars, called churches slow, And raced -- but this she did not know.  For Belial Machiavelli kept The little fact a secret, and, Though o'er his minor sins she wept, Jane Austen did not understand That Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay Absorbed one-half her husband's pay.  She was so good, she made hime worse; (Some women are like this, I think;) He taught her parrot how to curse, Her Assam monkey how to drink. He vexed her righteous soul until She went up, and he went down hill.  Then came the crisis, strange to say, Which turned a good wife to a better. A telegraphic peon, one day, Brought her -- now, had it been a letter For Belial Machiavelli, I Know Jane would just have let it lie.  But 'twas a telegram instead, Marked \"urgent,\" and her duty plain To open it. Jane Austen read: \"Your Lilly's got a cough again. Can't understand why she is kept At your expense.\" Jane Austen wept.  It was a misdirected wire. Her husband was at Shaitanpore. She spread her anger, hot as fire, Through six thin foreign sheets or more. Sent off that letter, wrote another To her solicitor -- and mother.  Then Belial Machiavelli saw Her error and, I trust, his own, Wired to the minion of the Law, And traveled wifeward -- not alone. For Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay -- Came in a horse-box all the way.  There was a scene -- a weep or two -- With many kisses. Austen Jane Rode Lilly all the season through, And never opened wires again. She races now with Belial. This Is very sad, but so it is. \r\n                         \n", "The King And The Sea": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        After His Realms and States were moved  To bare their hearts to the King they loved,  Tendering themselves in homage and devotion,  The Tide Wave up the Channel spoke To all those eager, exultant folk:- 'Hear now what Man was given you by the Ocean!   'There was no thought of Orb or Crown When the single wooden chest went down To the steering-flat, and the careless Gunroom haled him  To learn by ancient and bitter use, How neither Favour nor Excuse, Nor aught save his sheer self henceforth availed him.   'There was no talk of birth or rank By the slung hammock or scrubbed plank  In the steel-grated prisons where 1 cast him;  But niggard hours and a narrow space For rest-and the naked light on his face- While the ship's traffic flowed, unceasing, past him.   'Thus I schooled him to go and come- To speak at the word-at a sign be dumb;  To stand to his task, not seeking others to aid him;  To share in honour what praise might fall For the task accomplished, and-over all- To swallow rebuke in silence. Thus I made him.   'I loosened every mood of the deep On him, a child and sick for sleep, Through the long watches that no time can measure,  When I drove him, deafened and choked and blind,  At the wave-tops cut and spun by the wind;  Lashing him, face and eyes, with my displeasure.  'I opened him all the guile of the seas- Their sullen, swift-sprung treacheries,  To be fought, or forestalled, or dared, or dismissed with laughter. I showed him Worth by Folly concealed,  And the flaw in the soul that a chance revealed  (Lessons remembered-to bear fruit thereafter).  'I dealt him Power beneath his hand, For trial and proof, with his first Command- Himself alone, and no man to gainsay him.  On him the End, the Means, and the Word,  And the harsher judgment if he erred,  And-outboard-Ocean waiting to betray him.   'Wherefore, when he came to be crowned,  Strength in Duty held him bound, So that not Power misled nor ease ensnared him Who had spared himself no more than his seas had spared him!'  After His Lieges, in all His Lands, Had laid their hands between His hands, And His ships thundered service and devotion,  The Tide Wave, ranging the Planet, spoke  On all Our foreshores as it broke:- 'Know now what Man 1 gave you-I, the Ocean!' \r\n                         \n"}
