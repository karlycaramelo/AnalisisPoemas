John Milton. 1608-1674   316. From 'Comus'  iv   The Spirit epiloguizes: TO the Ocean now I fly,  And those happy climes that ly  Where day never shuts his eye,  Up in the broad fields of the sky:  There I suck the liquid ayr  All amidst the Gardens fair  Of Hesperus, and his daughters three  That sing about the golden tree:  Along the crisped shades and bowres  Revels the spruce and jocond Spring,  The Graces, and the rosie-boosom'd Howres,  Thither all their bounties bring,  That there eternal Summer dwels,  And West winds, with musky wing  About the cedar'n alleys fling  Nard, and Cassia's balmy smels.  Iris there with humid bow,  Waters the odorous banks that blow  Flowers of more mingled hew  Than her purfl'd scarf can shew,  And drenches with Elysian dew  (List mortals, if your ears be true)  Beds of Hyacinth, and roses  Where young Adonis oft reposes,  Waxing well of his deep wound  In slumber soft, and on the ground  Sadly sits th' Assyrian Queen;  But far above in spangled sheen  Celestial Cupid her fam'd son advanc't,  Holds his dear Psyche sweet intranc't  After her wandring labours long,  Till free consent the gods among  Make her his eternal Bride,  And from her fair unspotted side  Two blissful twins are to be born,  Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now my task is smoothly don,  I can fly, or I can run  Quickly to the green earths end,  Where the bow'd welkin slow doth bend,  And from thence can soar as soon  To the corners of the Moon.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mortals that would follow me,  Love vertue, she alone is free.  She can teach ye how to clime  Higher then the Spheary chime;  Or if Vertue feeble were,  Heav'n it self would stoop to her.   YET once more, O ye Laurels, and once more  Ye Myrtles brown, with Ivy never-sear,  I com to pluck your Berries harsh and crude,  And with forc'd fingers rude,  Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.  Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,  Compels me to disturb your season due:  For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime  Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:  Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew  Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.  He must not flote upon his watry bear  Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,  Without the meed of som melodious tear.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Begin, then, Sisters of the sacred well,  That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring,  Begin, and somwhat loudly sweep the string.  Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse,  So may som gentle Muse  With lucky words favour my destin'd Urn,  And as he passes turn,  And bid fair peace be to my sable shrowd.  For we were nurst upon the self-same hill,  Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together both, ere the high Lawns appear'd  Under the opening eye-lids of the morn,  We drove a field, and both together heard  What time the Gray-fly winds her sultry horn,  Batt'ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night,  Oft till the Star that rose, at Ev'ning, bright  Toward Heav'ns descent had slop'd his westering wheel.  Mean while the Rural ditties were not mute,  Temper'd to th'Oaten Flute;  Rough Satyrs danc'd, and Fauns with clov'n heel,  From the glad sound would not be absent long,  And old Damaetas lov'd to hear our song.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But O the heavy change, now thou art gon,  Now thou art gon, and never must return!  Thee Shepherd, thee the Woods, and desert Caves,  With wilde Thyme and the gadding Vine o'regrown,  And all their echoes mourn.  The Willows, and the Hazle Copses green,  Shall now no more be seen,  Fanning their joyous Leaves to thy soft layes.  As killing as the Canker to the Rose,  Or Taint-worm to the weanling Herds that graze,  Or Frost to Flowers, that their gay wardrop wear,  When first the White thorn blows;  Such, Lycidas, thy loss to Shepherds ear.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where were ye Nymphs when the remorseless deep  Clos'd o're the head of your lov'd Lycidas?  For neither were ye playing on the steep,  Where your old Bards, the famous Druids ly,  Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,  Nor yet where Deva spreads her wisard stream:  Ay me, I fondly dream!  Had ye bin there--for what could that have don?  What could the Muse her self that Orpheus bore,  The Muse her self, for her inchanting son  Whom Universal nature did lament,  When by the rout that made the hideous roar,  His goary visage down the stream was sent,  Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! what boots it with uncessant care  To tend the homely slighted Shepherds trade,  And strictly meditate the thankles Muse,  Were it not better don as others use,  To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,  Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?  Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise  (That last infirmity of Noble mind)  To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes;  But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find,  And think to burst out into sudden blaze,  Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears,  And slits the thin spun life. But not the praise,  Phoebus repli'd, and touch'd my trembling ears;  Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,  Nor in the glistering foil  Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies,  But lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes,  And perfet witnes of all judging Jove;  As he pronounces lastly on each deed,  Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd floud,  Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocall reeds,  That strain I heard was of a higher mood:  But now my Oate proceeds,  And listens to the Herald of the Sea  That came in Neptune's plea,  He ask'd the Waves, and ask'd the Fellon winds,  What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?  And question'd every gust of rugged wings  That blows from off each beaked Promontory,  They knew not of his story,  And sage Hippotades their answer brings,  That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd,  The Ayr was calm, and on the level brine,  Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd.  It was that fatall and perfidious Bark  Built in th'eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,  That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next Camus, reverend Sire, went footing slow,  His Mantle hairy, and his Bonnet sedge,  Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge  Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe.  Ah; Who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge?  Last came, and last did go,  The Pilot of the Galilean lake,  Two massy Keyes he bore of metals twain,  (The Golden opes, the Iron shuts amain)  He shook his Miter'd locks, and stern bespake,  How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain,  Anow of such as for their bellies sake,  Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold?  Of other care they little reck'ning make,  Then how to scramble at the shearers feast,  And shove away the worthy bidden guest.  Blind mouthes! that scarce themselves know how to hold  A Sheep-hook, or have learn'd ought els the least  That to the faithfull Herdmans art belongs!  What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;  And when they list, their lean and flashy songs  Grate on their scrannel Pipes of wretched straw,  The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed,  But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,  Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:  Besides what the grim Woolf with privy paw  Daily devours apace, and nothing sed,  But that two-handed engine at the door,  Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Return Alpheus, the dread voice is past,  That shrunk thy streams; Return Sicilian Muse,  And call the Vales, and bid them hither cast  Their Bels, and Flourets of a thousand hues.  Ye valleys low where the milde whispers use,  Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,  On whose fresh lap the swart Star sparely looks,  Throw hither all your quaint enameld eyes,  That on the green terf suck the honied showres,  And purple all the ground with vernal flowres.  Bring the rathe Primrose that forsaken dies.  The tufted Crow-toe, and pale Gessamine,  The white Pink, and the Pansie freakt with jeat,  The glowing Violet.  The Musk-rose, and the well attir'd Woodbine.  With Cowslips wan that hang the pensive hed,  And every flower that sad embroidery wears:  Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,  And Daffadillies fill their cups with tears,  To strew the Laureat Herse where Lycid lies.  For so to interpose a little ease,  Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.  Ay me! Whilst thee the shores, and sounding Seas  Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurld,  Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,  Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide  Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;  Or whether thou to our moist vows deny'd,  Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,  Where the great vision of the guarded Mount  Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold;  Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth.  And, O ye Dolphins, waft the haples youth.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weep no more, woful Shepherds weep no more,  For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,  Sunk though he be beneath the watry floar,  So sinks the day-star in the Ocean bed,  And yet anon repairs his drooping head,  And tricks his beams, and with new spangled Ore,  Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:  So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,  Through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves  Where other groves, and other streams along,  With Nectar pure his oozy Lock's he laves,  And hears the unexpressive nuptiall Song,  In the blest Kingdoms meek of joy and love.  There entertain him all the Saints above,  In solemn troops, and sweet Societies  That sing, and singing in their glory move,  And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.  Now Lycidas the Shepherds weep no more;  Hence forth thou art the Genius of the shore,  In thy large recompense, and shalt be good  To all that wander in that perilous flood.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus sang the uncouth Swain to th'Okes and rills,  While the still morn went out with Sandals gray,  He touch'd the tender stops of various Quills,  With eager thought warbling his Dorick lay:  And now the Sun had stretch'd out all the hills,  And now was dropt into the Western bay;  At last he rose, and twitch'd his Mantle blew:  To morrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet 22": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        XXII  Cyriac, this three years' day these eyes, though clear, To outward view, of blemish or of spot, Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot; Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear Of sun, or moon, or star, throughout the year, Or man, or woman.

Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, And for a time caught up to God, as once Moses was in the Mount and missing long, And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.

To honour? no; But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold, That to the fall and rising he should be Of many in Israel, and to a sign Spoken against\u2014that through my very soul                    A sword shall pierce.  This is my favoured lot, My exaltation to afflictions high! Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest! I will not argue that, nor will repine. But where delays he now?  Some great intent Conceals him.  When twelve years he scarce had seen, I lost him, but so found as well I saw He could not lose himself, but went about His Father's business.  What he meant I mused\u2014 Since understand; much more his absence now                  Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. But I to wait with patience am inured; My heart hath been a storehouse long of things And sayings laid up, pretending strange events.\"   Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind Recalling what remarkably had passed Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling: The while her Son, tracing the desert wild, Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,                      Into himself descended, and at once All his great work to come before him set\u2014 How to begin, how to accomplish best His end of being on Earth, and mission high. For Satan, with sly preface to return, Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone Up to the middle region of thick air, Where all his Potentates in council sate. There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy, Solicitous and blank, he thus began:\u2014                         \"Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones\u2014 Daemonian Spirits now, from the element Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath (So may we hold our place and these mild seats Without new trouble!)\u2014such an enemy Is risen to invade us, who no less Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell. I, as I undertook, and with the vote Consenting in full frequence was impowered,                  Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find Far other labour to be undergone Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men, Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell, However to this Man inferior far\u2014 If he be Man by mother's side, at least With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned, Perfections absolute, graces divine, And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds. Therefore I am returned, lest confidence                     Of my success with Eve in Paradise Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure Of like succeeding here.  I summon all Rather to be in readiness with hand Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst Thought none my equal, now be overmatched.\"   So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all With clamour was assured their utmost aid At his command; when from amidst them rose Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,                    The sensualest, and, after Asmodai, The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:\u2014   \"Set women in his eye and in his walk, Among daughters of men the fairest found. Many are in each region passing fair As the noon sky, more like to goddesses Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet, Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,                 Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets. Such object hath the power to soften and tame Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, Draw out with credulous desire, and lead At will the manliest, resolutest breast, As the magnetic hardest iron draws. Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,                       And made him bow, to the gods of his wives.\"   To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:\u2014 \"Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st All others by thyself.  Because of old Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace, None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew, False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth, Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,                    And coupled with them, and begot a race. Have we not seen, or by relation heard, In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st, In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side, In valley or green meadow, to waylay Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more Too long\u2014then lay'st thy scapes on names adored, Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,                            Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan?  But these haunts Delight not all.  Among the sons of men How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned All her assaults, on worthier things intent! Remember that Pellean conqueror, A youth, how all the beauties of the East He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed; How he surnamed of Africa dismissed, In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.                   For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond Higher design than to enjoy his state; Thence to the bait of women lay exposed. But he whom we attempt is wiser far Than Solomon, of more exalted mind, Made and set wholly on the accomplishment Of greatest things.  What woman will you find, Though of this age the wonder and the fame, On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye                     Of fond desire?  Or should she, confident, As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne, Descend with all her winning charms begirt To enamour, as the zone of Venus once Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell), How would one look from his majestic brow, Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill, Discountenance her despised, and put to rout All her array, her female pride deject, Or turn to reverent awe!  For Beauty stands                  In the admiration only of weak minds Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy, At every sudden slighting quite abashed. Therefore with manlier objects we must try His constancy\u2014with such as have more shew Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise (Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked); Or that which only seems to satisfy Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.                        And now I know he hungers, where no food Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness: The rest commit to me; I shall let pass No advantage, and his strength as oft assay.\"   He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim; Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band Of Spirits likest to himself in guile, To be at hand and at his beck appear, If cause were to unfold some active scene Of various persons, each to know his part;                   Then to the desert takes with these his flight, Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God, After forty days' fasting, had remained, Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:\u2014   \"Where will this end?  Four times ten days I have passed Wandering this woody maze, and human food Nor tasted, nor had appetite.  That fast To virtue I impute not, or count part Of what I suffer here.  If nature need not, Or God support nature without repast,                        Though needing, what praise is it to endure? But now I feel I hunger; which declares Nature hath need of what she asks.  Yet God Can satisfy that need some other way, Though hunger still remain.  So it remain Without this body's wasting, I content me, And from the sting of famine fear no harm; Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed Me hungering more to do my Father's will.\"   It was the hour of night, when thus the Son                Communed in silent walk, then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of trees thick interwoven.  There he slept, And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream, Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet. Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood, And saw the ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing even and morn\u2014 Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought; He saw the Prophet also, how he fled                         Into the desert, and how there he slept Under a juniper\u2014then how, awaked, He found his supper on the coals prepared, And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, And eat the second time after repose, The strength whereof sufficed him forty days: Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry                The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song. As lightly from his grassy couch up rose Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream; Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked. Up to a hill anon his steps he reared, From whose high top to ken the prospect round, If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd; But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw\u2014 Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove, With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.                Thither he bent his way, determined there To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown, That opened in the midst a woody scene; Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art), And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs.  He viewed it round; When suddenly a man before him stood, Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, As one in city or court or palace bred,                      And with fair speech these words to him addressed:\u2014   \"With granted leave officious I return, But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide, Of all things destitute, and, well I know, Not without hunger.  Others of some note, As story tells, have trod this wilderness: The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son, Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief By a providing Angel; all the race                           Of Israel here had famished, had not God Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold, Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. Of thee those forty days none hath regard, Forty and more deserted here indeed.\"   To whom thus Jesus:\u2014\"What conclud'st thou hence? They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none.\"   \"How hast thou hunger then?\" Satan replied. \"Tell me, if food were now before thee set,                  Wouldst thou not eat?\"  \"Thereafter as I like the giver,\" answered Jesus.  \"Why should that Cause thy refusal?\" said the subtle Fiend. \"Hast thou not right to all created things? Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee Duty and service, nor to stay till bid, But tender all their power?  Nor mention I Meats by the law unclean, or offered first To idols\u2014those young Daniel could refuse; Nor proffered by an enemy\u2014though who                        Would scruple that, with want oppressed?  Behold, Nature ashamed, or, better to express, Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed From all the elements her choicest store, To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord With honour.  Only deign to sit and eat.\"   He spake no dream; for, as his words had end, Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld, In ample space under the broadest shade, A table richly spread in regal mode,                         With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort And savour\u2014beasts of chase, or fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled, Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore, Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin, And exquisitest name, for which was drained Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast. Alas! how simple, to these cates compared, Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,                     That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more, Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood, Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since Of faery damsels met in forest wide By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,                          Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore. And all the while harmonious airs were heard Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renewed:\u2014   \"What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure;                   Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs, Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord. What doubt'st thou, Son of God?  Sit down and eat.\"   To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:\u2014 \"Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? And who withholds my power that right to use?                Shall I receive by gift what of my own, When and where likes me best, I can command? I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, Command a table in this wilderness, And call swift flights of Angels ministrant, Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend: Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence In vain, where no acceptance it can find? And with my hunger what hast thou to do? Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,                            And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles.\"   To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:\u2014 \"That I have also power to give thou seest; If of that power I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased, And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need, Why shouldst thou not accept it?  But I see What I can do or offer is suspect. Of these things others quickly will dispose,                 Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil.\"  With that Both table and provision vanished quite, With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard; Only the importune Tempter still remained, And with these words his temptation pursued:\u2014   \"By hunger, that each other creature tames, Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved; Thy temperance, invincible besides, For no allurement yields to appetite; And all thy heart is set on high designs,                    High actions.  But wherewith to be achieved? Great acts require great means of enterprise; Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, A carpenter thy father known, thyself Bred up in poverty and straits at home, Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit. Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire To greatness? whence authority deriv'st? What followers, what retinue canst thou gain, Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude,                         Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost? Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms. What raised Antipater the Edomite, And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne, Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends? Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap\u2014 Not difficult, if thou hearken to me. Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand; They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,                   While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want.\"   To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:\u2014 \"Yet wealth without these three is impotent To gain dominion, or to keep it gained\u2014 Witness those ancient empires of the earth, In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved; But men endued with these have oft attained, In lowest poverty, to highest deeds\u2014 Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate                   So many ages, and shall yet regain That seat, and reign in Israel without end. Among the Heathen (for throughout the world To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? For I esteem those names of men so poor, Who could do mighty things, and could contemn Riches, though offered from the hand of kings. And what in me seems wanting but that I                      May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools, The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt To slacken virtue and abate her edge Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise. What if with like aversion I reject Riches and realms!  Yet not for that a crown, Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights,       To him who wears the regal diadem, When on his shoulders each man's burden lies; For therein stands the office of a king, His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise, That for the public all this weight he bears. Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king\u2014 Which every wise and virtuous man attains; And who attains not, ill aspires to rule Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,                     Subject himself to anarchy within, Or lawless passions in him, which he serves. But to guide nations in the way of truth By saving doctrine, and from error lead To know, and, knowing, worship God aright, Is yet more kingly.  This attracts the soul, Governs the inner man, the nobler part; That other o'er the body only reigns, And oft by force\u2014which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight.                       Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done, and to lay down Far more magnanimous, than to assume. Riches are needless, then, both for themselves, And for thy reason why they should be sought\u2014 To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed.\" \r\n                         \n", "Psalm 84": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        How lovely are thy dwellings fair!

Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand                To all baptized.  To his great baptism flocked With awe the regions round, and with them came From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed To the flood Jordan\u2014came as then obscure, Unmarked, unknown.  But him the Baptist soon Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore As to his worthier, and would have resigned To him his heavenly office.  Nor was long His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove                     The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son. That heard the Adversary, who, roving still About the world, at that assembly famed Would not be last, and, with the voice divine Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom Such high attest was given a while surveyed With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage, Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air To council summons all his mighty Peers,                     Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved, A gloomy consistory; and them amidst, With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:\u2014   \"O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World (For much more willingly I mention Air, This our old conquest, than remember Hell, Our hated habitation), well ye know How many ages, as the years of men, This Universe we have possessed, and ruled In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,                  Since Adam and his facile consort Eve Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since With dread attending when that fatal wound Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve Upon my head.  Long the decrees of Heaven Delay, for longest time to Him is short; And now, too soon for us, the circling hours This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound (At least, if so we can, and by the head                     Broken be not intended all our power To be infringed, our freedom and our being In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)\u2014 For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed, Destined to this, is late of woman born. His birth to our just fear gave no small cause; But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim                      His coming, is sent harbinger, who all Invites, and in the consecrated stream Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so Purified to receive him pure, or rather To do him honour as their King.  All come, And he himself among them was baptized\u2014 Not thence to be more pure, but to receive The testimony of Heaven, that who he is Thenceforth the nations may not doubt.  I saw The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising                 Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant); And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard, 'This is my Son beloved,\u2014in him am pleased.' His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven; And what will He not do to advance his Son? His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;                Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems In all his lineaments, though in his face The glimpses of his Father's glory shine. Ye see our danger on the utmost edge Of hazard, which admits no long debate, But must with something sudden be opposed (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares), Ere in the head of nations he appear, Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth. I, when no other durst, sole undertook                       The dismal expedition to find out And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed Successfully: a calmer voyage now Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once Induces best to hope of like success.\"   He ended, and his words impression left Of much amazement to the infernal crew, Distracted and surprised with deep dismay At these sad tidings.  But no time was then For long indulgence to their fears or grief:                 Unanimous they all commit the care And management of this man enterprise To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt At first against mankind so well had thrived In Adam's overthrow, and led their march From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light, Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods, Of many a pleasant realm and province wide. So to the coast of Jordan he directs His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,                     Where he might likeliest find this new-declared, This man of men, attested Son of God, Temptation and all guile on him to try\u2014 So to subvert whom he suspected raised To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed: But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed, Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:\u2014   \"Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,           Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth With Man or men's affairs, how I begin To verify that solemn message late, On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure In Galilee, that she should bear a son, Great in renown, and called the Son of God. Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be To her a virgin, that on her should come The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest O'ershadow her.  This Man, born and now upgrown,             To shew him worthy of his birth divine And high prediction, henceforth I expose To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay His utmost subtlety, because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng Of his Apostasy.  He might have learnt Less overweening, since he failed in Job, Whose constant perseverance overcame Whate'er his cruel malice could invent. He now shall know I can produce a man,                       Of female seed, far abler to resist All his solicitations, and at length All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell\u2014 Winning by conquest what the first man lost By fallacy surprised.  But first I mean To exercise him in the Wilderness; There he shall first lay down the rudiments Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes. By humiliation and strong sufferance                         His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength, And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; That all the Angels and aethereal Powers\u2014 They now, and men hereafter\u2014may discern From what consummate virtue I have chose This perfet man, by merit called my Son, To earn salvation for the sons of men.\"   So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven Admiring stood a space; then into hymns Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,                Circling the throne and singing, while the hand Sung with the voice, and this the argument:\u2014   \"Victory and triumph to the Son of God, Now entering his great duel, not of arms, But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles! The Father knows the Son; therefore secure Ventures his filial virtue, though untried, Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce, Allure, or terrify, or undermine. Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,                     And, devilish machinations, come to nought!\"   So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned. Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized, Musing and much revolving in his breast How best the mighty work he might begin Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first Publish his godlike office now mature, One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading And his deep thoughts, the better to converse                With solitude, till, far from track of men, Thought following thought, and step by step led on, He entered now the bordering Desert wild, And, with dark shades and rocks environed round, His holy meditations thus pursued:\u2014   \"O what a multitude of thoughts at once Awakened in me swarm, while I consider What from within I feel myself, and hear What from without comes often to my ears, Ill sorting with my present state compared!                  When I was yet a child, no childish play To me was pleasing; all my mind was set Serious to learn and know, and thence to do, What might be public good; myself I thought Born to that end, born to promote all truth, All righteous things.  Therefore, above my years, The Law of God I read, and found it sweet; Made it my whole delight, and in it grew To such perfection that, ere yet my age Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast             I went into the Temple, there to hear The teachers of our Law, and to propose What might improve my knowledge or their own, And was admired by all.  Yet this not all To which my spirit aspired.  Victorious deeds Flamed in my heart, heroic acts\u2014one while To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke; Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth, Brute violence and proud tyrannic power, Till truth were freed, and equity restored:                  Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first By winning words to conquer willing hearts, And make persuasion do the work of fear; At least to try, and teach the erring soul, Not wilfully misdoing, but unware Misled; the stubborn only to subdue. These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving, By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced, And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts, O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar                   To what highth sacred virtue and true worth Can raise them, though above example high; By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire. For know, thou art no son of mortal man; Though men esteem thee low of parentage, Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men. A messenger from God foretold thy birth Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,           And of thy kingdom there should be no end. At thy nativity a glorious quire Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung To shepherds, watching at their folds by night, And told them the Messiah now was born, Where they might see him; and to thee they came, Directed to the manger where thou lay'st; For in the inn was left no better room. A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing, Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,                   To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold; By whose bright course led on they found the place, Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven, By which they knew thee King of Israel born. Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake, Before the altar and the vested priest, Like things of thee to all that present stood.' This having heart, straight I again revolved The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ                Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake I am\u2014this chiefly, that my way must lie Through many a hard assay, even to the death, Ere I the promised kingdom can attain, Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins' Full weight must be transferred upon my head. Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed, The time prefixed I waited; when behold The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,                 Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come Before Messiah, and his way prepare! I, as all others, to his baptism came, Which I believed was from above; but he Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)\u2014 Me him whose harbinger he was; and first Refused on me his baptism to confer, As much his greater, and was hardly won. But, as I rose out of the laving stream,                     Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence The Spirit descended on me like a Dove; And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice, Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his, Me his beloved Son, in whom alone He was well pleased: by which I knew the time Now full, that I no more should live obscure, But openly begin, as best becomes The authority which I derived from Heaven. And now by some strong motion I am led                       Into this wilderness; to what intent I learn not yet.  Perhaps I need not know; For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.\"   So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise, And, looking round, on every side beheld A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades. The way he came, not having marked return, Was difficult, by human steps untrod; And he still on was led, but with such thoughts Accompanied of things past and to come                       Lodged in his breast as well might recommend Such solitude before choicest society.   Full forty days he passed\u2014whether on hill Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night Under the covert of some ancient oak Or cedar to defend him from the dew, Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed; Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt, Till those days ended; hungered then at last Among wild beasts.  They at his sight grew mild,             Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm; The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof. But now an aged man in rural weeds, Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye, Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen, To warm him wet returned from field at eve, He saw approach; who first with curious eye Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:\u2014             \"Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place, So far from path or road of men, who pass In troop or caravan? for single none Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth. I ask the rather, and the more admire, For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son Of God.  I saw and heard, for we sometimes                   Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth To town or village nigh (nighest is far), Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear, What happens new; fame also finds us out.\"   To whom the Son of God:\u2014\"Who brought me hither Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek.\"   \"By miracle he may,\" replied the swain; \"What other way I see not; for we here Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured More than the camel, and to drink go far\u2014                   Men to much misery and hardship born. But, if thou be the Son of God, command That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.\"   He ended, and the Son of God replied:\u2014 \"Think'st thou such force in bread?  Is it not written (For I discern thee other than thou seem'st), Man lives not by bread only, but each word Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed                    Our fathers here with manna?  In the Mount Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank; And forty days Eliah without food Wandered this barren waste; the same I now. Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?\"   Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:\u2014 \"'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt, Kept not my happy station, but was driven                    With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep\u2014 Yet to that hideous place not so confined By rigour unconniving but that oft, Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy Large liberty to round this globe of Earth, Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. I came, among the Sons of God, when he Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job, To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;                 And, when to all his Angels he proposed To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud, That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring, I undertook that office, and the tongues Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies To his destruction, as I had in charge: For what he bids I do.  Though I have lost Much lustre of my native brightness, lost To be beloved of God, I have not lost To love, at least contemplate and admire,                    What I see excellent in good, or fair, Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense. What can be then less in me than desire To see thee and approach thee, whom I know Declared the Son of God, to hear attent Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds? Men generally think me much a foe To all mankind.  Why should I? they to me Never did wrong or violence.  By them I lost not what I lost; rather by them                       I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell Copartner in these regions of the World, If not disposer\u2014lend them oft my aid, Oft my advice by presages and signs, And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams, Whereby they may direct their future life. Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain Companions of my misery and woe! At first it may be; but, long since with woe Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof                       That fellowship in pain divides not smart, Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load; Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined. This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man, Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more.\"   To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:\u2014 \"Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies From the beginning, and in lies wilt end, Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come Into the Heaven of Heavens.  Thou com'st, indeed,            As a poor miserable captive thrall Comes to the place where he before had sat Among the prime in splendour, now deposed, Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned, A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn, To all the host of Heaven.  The happy place Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy\u2014 Rather inflames thy torment, representing Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable; So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.                   But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King! Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him With all inflictions? but his patience won. The other service was thy chosen task, To be a liar in four hundred mouths; For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles                    By thee are given, and what confessed more true Among the nations?  That hath been thy craft, By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies. But what have been thy answers? what but dark, Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding, Which they who asked have seldom understood, And, not well understood, as good not known? Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine, Returned the wiser, or the more instruct To fly or follow what concerned him most,                    And run not sooner to his fatal snare? For God hath justly given the nations up To thy delusions; justly, since they fell Idolatrous.  But, when his purpose is Among them to declare his providence, To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, But from him, or his Angels president In every province, who, themselves disdaining To approach thy temples, give thee in command What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say                 To thy adorers?  Thou, with trembling fear, Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st; Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold. But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched; No more shalt thou by oracling abuse The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased, And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere\u2014 At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. God hath now sent his living Oracle                          Into the world to teach his final will, And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell In pious hearts, an inward oracle To all truth requisite for men to know.\"   So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, Though inly stung with anger and disdain, Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:\u2014   \"Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, And urged me hard with doings which not will, But misery, hath wrested from me.  Where                     Easily canst thou find one miserable, And not inforced oft-times to part from truth, If it may stand him more in stead to lie, Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord; From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear, And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;                          What wonder, then, if I delight to hear Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire Virtue who follow not her lore.  Permit me To hear thee when I come (since no man comes), And talk at least, though I despair to attain. Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure, Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest To tread his sacred courts, and minister About his altar, handling holy things, Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice                   To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet Inspired: disdain not such access to me.\"   To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:\u2014 \"Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, I bid not, or forbid.  Do as thou find'st Permission from above; thou canst not more.\"   He added not; and Satan, bowling low His gray dissimulation, disappeared, Into thin air diffused: for now began Night with her sullen wing to double-shade                   The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched; And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam. \r\n                         \n", "When The Assault Was Intended To The City": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Captain, or colonel, or knight in arms,  Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize,  If deed of honour did thee ever please,  Guard them, and him within protect from harms.

Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult, Thy counsel would be as the oracle Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds That might require the array of war, thy skill Of conduct would be such that all the world Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist In battle, though against thy few in arms.                   These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide? Affecting private life, or more obscure In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself The fame and glory\u2014glory, the reward That sole excites to high attempts the flame Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise, All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, And dignities and powers, all but the highest?               Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe.  The son Of Macedonian Philip had ere these Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode. Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. Great Julius, whom now all the world admires, The more he grew in years, the more inflamed                 With glory, wept that he had lived so long Ingloroious.  But thou yet art not too late.\"   To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:\u2014 \"Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth For empire's sake, nor empire to affect For glory's sake, by all thy argument. For what is glory but the blaze of fame, The people's praise, if always praise unmixed? And what the people but a herd confused, A miscellaneous rabble, who extol                            Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise? They praise and they admire they know not what, And know not whom, but as one leads the other; And what delight to be by such extolled, To live upon their tongues, and be their talk? Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise\u2014 His lot who dares be singularly good. The intelligent among them and the wise Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised. This is true glory and renown\u2014when God,                     Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks The just man, and divulges him through Heaven To all his Angels, who with true applause Recount his praises.  Thus he did to Job, When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth, As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember, He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?' Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known, Where glory is false glory, attributed To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.              They err who count it glorious to subdue By conquest far and wide, to overrun Large countries, and in field great battles win, Great cities by assault.  What do these worthies But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote, Made captive, yet deserving freedom more Than those their conquerors, who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove, And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;              Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods, Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice? One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other; Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men, Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed, Violent or shameful death their due reward. But, if there be in glory aught of good; It may be means far different be attained, Without ambition, war, or violence\u2014                         By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, By patience, temperance.  I mention still Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne, Made famous in a land and times obscure; Who names not now with honour patient Job? Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?) By what he taught and suffered for so doing, For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now Equal in fame to proudest conquerors. Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,                    Aught suffered\u2014if young African for fame His wasted country freed from Punic rage\u2014 The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least, And loses, though but verbal, his reward. Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek, Oft not deserved?  I seek not mine, but His Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am.\"   To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:\u2014 \"Think not so slight of glory, therein least Resembling thy great Father.  He seeks glory,                And for his glory all things made, all things Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven, By all his Angels glorified, requires Glory from men, from all men, good or bad, Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption. Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift, Glory he requires, and glory he receives, Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek, Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared; From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts.\"                To whom our Saviour fervently replied: \"And reason; since his Word all things produced, Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, But to shew forth his goodness, and impart His good communicable to every soul Freely; of whom what could He less expect Than glory and benediction\u2014that is, thanks\u2014 The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense From them who could return him nothing else, And, not returning that, would likeliest render              Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? Hard recompense, unsuitable return For so much good, so much beneficience! But why should man seek glory, who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame\u2014 Who, for so many benefits received, Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoiled; Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take                     That which to God alone of right belongs? Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, That who advances his glory, not their own, Them he himself to glory will advance.\"   So spake the Son of God; and here again Satan had not to answer, but stood struck With guilt of his own sin\u2014for he himself, Insatiable of glory, had lost all; Yet of another plea bethought him soon:\u2014   \"Of glory, as thou wilt,\" said he, \"so deem;               Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass. But to a Kingdom thou art born\u2014ordained To sit upon thy father David's throne, By mother's side thy father, though thy right Be now in powerful hands, that will not part Easily from possession won with arms. Judaea now and all the Promised Land, Reduced a province under Roman yoke, Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled With temperate sway: oft have they violated                  The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts, Abominations rather, as did once Antiochus.  And think'st thou to regain Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring? So did not Machabeus.  He indeed Retired unto the Desert, but with arms; And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed That by strong hand his family obtained, Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped, With Modin and her suburbs once content.                     If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal And duty\u2014zeal and duty are not slow, But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait: They themselves rather are occasion best\u2014 Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free Thy country from her heathen servitude. So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify, The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign\u2014 The happier reign the sooner it begins. Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?\"               To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:\u2014 \"All things are best fulfilled in their due time; And time there is for all things, Truth hath said. If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told That it shall never end, so, when begin The Father in his purpose hath decreed\u2014 He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl. What if he hath decreed that I shall first Be tried in humble state, and things adverse, By tribulations, injuries, insults,                          Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting Without distrust or doubt, that He may know What I can suffer, how obey?  Who best Can suffer best can do, best reign who first Well hath obeyed\u2014just trial ere I merit My exaltation without change or end. But what concerns it thee when I begin My everlasting Kingdom?  Why art thou Solicitous?  What moves thy inquisition?                     Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall, And my promotion will be thy destruction?\"   To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:\u2014 \"Let that come when it comes.  All hope is lost Of my reception into grace; what worse? For where no hope is left is left no fear. If there be worse, the expectation more Of worse torments me than the feeling can. I would be at the worst; worst is my port, My harbour, and my ultimate repose,                          The end I would attain, my final good. My error was my error, and my crime My crime; whatever, for itself condemned, And will alike be punished, whether thou Reign or reign not\u2014though to that gentle brow Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign, From that placid aspect and meek regard, Rather than aggravate my evil state, Would stand between me and thy Father's ire (Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)               A shelter and a kind of shading cool Interposition, as a summer's cloud. If I, then, to the worst that can be haste, Why move thy feet so slow to what is best? Happiest, both to thyself and all the world, That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King! Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained Of the enterprise so hazardous and high! No wonder; for, though in thee be united What of perfection can in Man be found,                      Or human nature can receive, consider Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns, And once a year Jerusalem, few days' Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe? The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts\u2014 Best school of best experience, quickest in sight In all things that to greatest actions lead. The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever                      Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty (As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom) Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous. But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state\u2014 Sufficient introduction to inform Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts, And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know How best their opposition to withstand.\"                       With that (such power was given him then), he took The Son of God up to a mountain high. It was a mountain at whose verdant feet A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed, The one winding, the other straight, and left between Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined, Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea. Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine; With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;      Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large The prospect was that here and there was room For barren desert, fountainless and dry. To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought Our Saviour, and new train of words began:\u2014   \"Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale, Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers, Cut shorter many a league.  Here thou behold'st Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds,                    Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on As far as Indus east, Euphrates west, And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay, And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth: Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall Several days' journey, built by Ninus old, Of that first golden monarchy the seat, And seat of Salmanassar, whose success Israel in long captivity still mourns; There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,                    As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice Judah and all thy father David's house Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis, His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there; Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates; There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, The drink of none but kings; of later fame, Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,                      The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon, Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold. All these the Parthian (now some ages past By great Arsaces led, who founded first That empire) under his dominion holds, From the luxurious kings of Antioch won. And just in time thou com'st to have a view Of his great power; for now the Parthian king In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host                      Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid He marches now in haste.  See, though from far, His thousands, in what martial equipage They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms, Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit\u2014 All horsemen, in which fight they most excel; See how in warlike muster they appear, In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings.\"   He looked, and saw what numbers numberless                 The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops In coats of mail and military pride. In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong, Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice Of many provinces from bound to bound\u2014 From Arachosia, from Candaor east, And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales; From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains Of Adiabene, Media, and the south                            Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven. He saw them in their forms of battle ranged, How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight; The field all iron cast a gleaming brown. Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn, Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight, Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers Of archers; nor of labouring pioners                         A multitude, with spades and axes armed, To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke: Mules after these, camels and dromedaries, And waggons fraught with utensils of war. Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, When Agrican, with all his northern powers, Besieged Albracea, as romances tell, The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win                  The fairest of her sex, Angelica, His daughter, sought by many prowest knights, Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane. Such and so numerous was their chivalry; At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed, And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:\u2014   \"That thou may'st know I seek not to engage Thy virtue, and not every way secure On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew             All this fair sight.  Thy kingdom, though foretold By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou Endeavour, as thy father David did, Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still In all things, and all men, supposes means; Without means used, what it predicts revokes. But say thou wert possessed of David's throne By free consent of all, none opposite, Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope Long to enjoy it quiet and secure                            Between two such enclosing enemies, Roman and Parthian?  Therefore one of these Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first, By my advice, as nearer, and of late Found able by invasion to annoy Thy country, and captive lead away her kings, Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound, Maugre the Roman.  It shall be my task To render thee the Parthian at dispose, Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.            By him thou shalt regain, without him not, That which alone can truly reinstall thee In David's royal seat, his true successor\u2014 Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes Whose offspring in his territory yet serve In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed: The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old Their fathers in the land of Egypt served, This offer sets before thee to deliver.                      These if from servitude thou shalt restore To their inheritance, then, nor till then, Thou on the throne of David in full glory, From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond, Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear.\"   To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:\u2014 \"Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm And fragile arms, much instrument of war, Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear                Vented much policy, and projects deep Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues, Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne! My time, I told thee (and that time for thee Were better farthest off), is not yet come. When that comes, think not thou to find me slack On my part aught endeavouring, or to need Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome                       Luggage of war there shewn me\u2014argument Of human weakness rather than of strength. My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes, I must deliver, if I mean to reign David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway To just extent over all Israel's sons! But whence to thee this zeal?  Where was it then For Israel, or for David, or his throne, When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride Of numbering Israel\u2014which cost the lives                    of threescore and ten thousand Israelites By three days' pestilence?  Such was thy zeal To Israel then, the same that now to me. As for those captive tribes, themselves were they Who wrought their own captivity, fell off From God to worship calves, the deities Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, And all the idolatries of heathen round, Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes; Nor in the land of their captivity                           Humbled themselves, or penitent besought The God of their forefathers, but so died Impenitent, and left a race behind Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain, And God with idols in their worship joined. Should I of these the liberty regard, Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony, Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed, Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps             Of Bethel and of Dan?  No; let them serve Their enemies who serve idols with God. Yet He at length, time to himself best known, Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call May bring them back, repentant and sincere, And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, While to their native land with joy they haste, As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, When to the Promised Land their fathers passed. To his due time and providence I leave them.\"                  So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. So fares it when with truth falsehood contends. \r\n                         \n", "Sonnet 17": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        XVII   Lawrence of vertuous Father vertuous Son, Now that the Fields are dank, and ways are mire, Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire Help wast a sullen day; what may be Won From the hard Season gaining: time will run On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire The frozen earth; and cloth in fresh attire The Lillie and Rose, that neither sow'd nor spun.

There is a cave  Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,  Where light and darkness in perpetual round  Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven  Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;  Light issues forth, and at the other door  Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour  To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well  Seem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn  Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold  Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,  Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain  Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,  Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,  Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:  War he perceived, war in procinct; and found  Already known what he for news had thought  To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed  Among those friendly Powers, who him received  With joy and acclamations loud, that one,  That of so many myriads fallen, yet one  Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill  They led him high applauded, and present  Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,  From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.  Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought  The better fight, who single hast maintained  Against revolted multitudes the cause  Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;  And for the testimony of truth hast borne  Universal reproach, far worse to bear  Than violence; for this was all thy care  To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds  Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now  Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,  Back on thy foes more glorious to return,  Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue  By force, who reason for their law refuse,  Right reason for their law, and for their King  Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.  Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,  And thou, in military prowess next,  Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons  Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,  By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,  Equal in number to that Godless crew  Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms  Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven  Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,  Into their place of punishment, the gulf  Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide  His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.  So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began  To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll  In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign  Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud  Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:  At which command the Powers militant,  That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined  Of union irresistible, moved on  In silence their bright legions, to the sound  Of instrumental harmony, that breathed  Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds  Under their God-like leaders, in the cause  Of God and his Messiah.  On they move  Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,  Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides  Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground  Their march was, and the passive air upbore  Their nimble tread; as when the total kind  Of birds, in orderly array on wing,  Came summoned over Eden to receive  Their names of thee; so over many a tract  Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,  Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last,  Far in the horizon to the north appeared  From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched  In battailous aspect, and nearer view  Bristled with upright beams innumerable  Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields  Various, with boastful argument portrayed,  The banded Powers of Satan hasting on  With furious expedition; for they weened  That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,  To win the mount of God, and on his throne  To set the Envier of his state, the proud  Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain  In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed  At first, that Angel should with Angel war,  And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet  So oft in festivals of joy and love  Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,  Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout  Of battle now began, and rushing sound  Of onset ended soon each milder thought.  High in the midst, exalted as a God,  The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,  Idol of majesty divine, enclosed  With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;  Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now  \"twixt host and host but narrow space was left,  A dreadful interval, and front to front  Presented stood in terrible array  Of hideous length:  Before the cloudy van,  On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,  Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,  Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;  Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood  Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,  And thus his own undaunted heart explores.  O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest  Should yet remain, where faith and realty  Remain not:  Wherefore should not strength and might  There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove  Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?  His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,  I mean to try, whose reason I have tried  Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,  That he, who in debate of truth hath won,  Should win in arms, in both disputes alike  Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,  When reason hath to deal with force, yet so  Most reason is that reason overcome.  So pondering, and from his armed peers  Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met  His daring foe, at this prevention more  Incensed, and thus securely him defied.  Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached  The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,  The throne of God unguarded, and his side  Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power  Or potent tongue:  Fool!not to think how vain  Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;  Who out of smallest things could, without end,  Have raised incessant armies to defeat  Thy folly; or with solitary hand  Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,  Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed  Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest  All are not of thy train; there be, who faith  Prefer, and piety to God, though then  To thee not visible, when I alone  Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent  From all:  My sect thou seest;now learn too late  How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.  Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,  Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour  Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest  From flight, seditious Angel! to receive  Thy merited reward, the first assay  Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,  Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose  A third part of the Gods, in synod met  Their deities to assert; who, while they feel  Vigour divine within them, can allow  Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comest  Before thy fellows, ambitious to win  From me some plume, that thy success may show  Destruction to the rest:  This pause between,  (Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,  At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven  To heavenly souls had been all one; but now  I see that most through sloth had rather serve,  Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!  Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,  Servility with freedom to contend,  As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.  To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.  Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find  Of erring, from the path of truth remote:  Unjustly thou depravest it with the name  Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,  Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same,  When he who rules is worthiest, and excels  Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,  To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled  Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,  Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;  Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.  Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve  In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine  Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;  Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while  From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,  This greeting on thy impious crest receive.  So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,  Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell  On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,  Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,  Such ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge  He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee  His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth  Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,  Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,  Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised  The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see  Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,  Presage of victory, and fierce desire  Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound  The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven  It sounded, and the faithful armies rung  Hosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze  The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined  The horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose,  And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now  Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed  Horrible discord, and the madding wheels  Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise  Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss  Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,  And flying vaulted either host with fire.  So under fiery cope together rushed  Both battles main, with ruinous assault  And inextinguishable rage.  All Heaven  Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth  Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when  Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought  On either side, the least of whom could wield  These elements, and arm him with the force  Of all their regions:  How much more of power  Army against army numberless to raise  Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,  Though not destroy, their happy native seat;  Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,  From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled  And limited their might; though numbered such  As each divided legion might have seemed  A numerous host; in strength each armed hand  A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed  Each warriour single as in chief, expert  When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway  Of battle, open when, and when to close  The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight,  None of retreat, no unbecoming deed  That argued fear; each on himself relied,  As only in his arm the moment lay  Of victory:  Deeds of eternal fame  Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread  That war and various; sometimes on firm ground  A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,  Tormented all the air; all air seemed then  Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale  The battle hung; till Satan, who that day  Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms  No equal, ranging through the dire attack  Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length  Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled  Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway  Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down  Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand  He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb  Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,  A vast circumference.  At his approach  The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil  Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end  Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued  Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown  And visage all inflamed first thus began.  Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,  Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest  These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,  Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,  And thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed  Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought  Misery, uncreated till the crime  Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled  Thy malice into thousands, once upright  And faithful, now proved false!  But think not here  To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out  From all her confines.  Heaven, the seat of bliss,  Brooks not the works of violence and war.  Hence then, and evil go with thee along,  Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;  Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,  Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,  Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,  Precipitate thee with augmented pain.  So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus  The Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind  Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds  Thou canst not.  Hast thou turned the least of these  To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise  Unvanquished, easier to transact with me  That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats  To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end  The strife which thou callest evil, but we style  The strife of glory; which we mean to win,  Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell  Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,  If not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force,  And join him named Almighty to thy aid,  I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.  They ended parle, and both addressed for fight  Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue  Of Angels, can relate, or to what things  Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift  Human imagination to such highth  Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,  Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,  Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.  Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air  Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields  Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood  In horrour:  From each hand with speed retired,  Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,  And left large field, unsafe within the wind  Of such commotion; such as, to set forth  Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke,  Among the constellations war were sprung,  Two planets, rushing from aspect malign  Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky  Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.  Together both with next to almighty arm  Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed  That might determine, and not need repeat,  As not of power at once; nor odds appeared  In might or swift prevention:  But the sword  Of Michael from the armoury of God  Was given him tempered so, that neither keen  Nor solid might resist that edge: it met  The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite  Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,  But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared  All his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain,  And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore  The griding sword with discontinuous wound  Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed,  Not long divisible; and from the gash  A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed  Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,  And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.  Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run  By Angels many and strong, who interposed  Defence, while others bore him on their shields  Back to his chariot, where it stood retired  From off the files of war:  There they him laid  Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,  To find himself not matchless, and his pride  Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath  His confidence to equal God in power.  Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout  Vital in every part, not as frail man  In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,  Cannot but by annihilating die;  Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound  Receive, no more than can the fluid air:  All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,  All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,  They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size  Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare.  Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved  Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,  And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array  Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,  And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound  Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven  Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon  Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms  And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing  Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,  Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,  Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,  Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods  Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,  Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.  Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy  The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow  Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence  Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.  I might relate of thousands, and their names  Eternize here on earth; but those elect  Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,  Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort,  In might though wonderous and in acts of war,  Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom  Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,  Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.  For strength from truth divided, and from just,  Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise  And ignominy; yet to glory aspires  Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:  Therefore eternal silence be their doom.  And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,  With many an inroad gored; deformed rout  Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground  With shivered armour strown, and on a heap  Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,  And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled  O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host  Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,  Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,  Fled ignominious, to such evil brought  By sin of disobedience; till that hour  Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.  Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,  In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,  Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;  Such high advantages their innocence  Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,  Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood  Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained  By wound, though from their place by violence moved,  Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven  Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,  And silence on the odious din of war:  Under her cloudy covert both retired,  Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten field  Michael and his Angels prevalent  Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,  Cherubick waving fires:  On the other part,  Satan with his rebellious disappeared,  Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,  His potentates to council called by night;  And in the midst thus undismayed began.  O now in danger tried, now known in arms  Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,  Found worthy not of liberty alone,  Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,  Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;  Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,  (And if one day, why not eternal days?)  What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send  Against us from about his throne, and judged  Sufficient to subdue us to his will,  But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems,  Of future we may deem him, though till now  Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,  Some disadvantage we endured and pain,  Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;  Since now we find this our empyreal form  Incapable of mortal injury,  Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,  Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.  Of evil then so small as easy think  The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,  Weapons more violent, when next we meet,  May serve to better us, and worse our foes,  Or equal what between us made the odds,  In nature none:  If other hidden cause  Left them superiour, while we can preserve  Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,  Due search and consultation will disclose.  He sat; and in the assembly next upstood  Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;  As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,  Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,  And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.  Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free  Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard  For Gods, and too unequal work we find,  Against unequal arms to fight in pain,  Against unpained, impassive; from which evil  Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails  Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain  Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands  Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well  Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,  But live content, which is the calmest life:  But pain is perfect misery, the worst  Of evils, and, excessive, overturns  All patience.  He, who therefore can invent  With what more forcible we may offend  Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm  Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves  No less than for deliverance what we owe.  Whereto with look composed Satan replied.  Not uninvented that, which thou aright  Believest so main to our success, I bring.  Which of us who beholds the bright surface  Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand,  This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned  With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;  Whose eye so superficially surveys  These things, as not to mind from whence they grow  Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,  Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched  With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth  So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?  These in their dark nativity the deep  Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;  Which, into hollow engines, long and round,  Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire  Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth  From far, with thundering noise, among our foes  Such implements of mischief, as shall dash  To pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands  Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed  The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.  Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,  Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;  Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined  Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.  He ended, and his words their drooping cheer  Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.  The invention all admired, and each, how he  To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed  Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought  Impossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race  In future days, if malice should abound,  Some one intent on mischief, or inspired  With devilish machination, might devise  Like instrument to plague the sons of men  For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.  Forthwith from council to the work they flew;  None arguing stood; innumerable hands  Were ready; in a moment up they turned  Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath  The originals of nature in their crude  Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam  They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,  Concocted and adusted they reduced  To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:  Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth  Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,  Whereof to found their engines and their balls  Of missive ruin; part incentive reed  Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.  So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,  Secret they finished, and in order set,  With silent circumspection, unespied.  Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,  Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms  The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood  Of golden panoply, refulgent host,  Soon banded; others from the dawning hills  Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,  Each quarter to descry the distant foe,  Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,  In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met  Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow  But firm battalion; back with speediest sail  Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,  Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.  Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,  Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit  This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud  He comes, and settled in his face I see  Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each  His adamantine coat gird well, and each  Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,  Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,  If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,  But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.  So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon  In order, quit of all impediment;  Instant without disturb they took alarm,  And onward moved embattled:  When behold!  Not distant far with heavy pace the foe  Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube  Training his devilish enginery, impaled  On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,  To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood  A while; but suddenly at head appeared  Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.  Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;  That all may see who hate us, how we seek  Peace and composure, and with open breast  Stand ready to receive them, if they like  Our overture; and turn not back perverse:  But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!  Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge  Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand  Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch  What we propound, and loud that all may hear!  So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce  Had ended; when to right and left the front  Divided, and to either flank retired:  Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,  A triple mounted row of pillars laid  On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,  Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,  With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)  Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths  With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,  Portending hollow truce:  At each behind  A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed  Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,  Collected stood within our thoughts amused,  Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds  Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied  With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,  But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,  From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar  Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,  And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul  Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail  Of iron globes; which, on the victor host  Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,  That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,  Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell  By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;  The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might  Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift  By quick contraction or remove; but now  Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;  Nor served it to relax their serried files.  What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse  Repeated, and indecent overthrow  Doubled, would render them yet more despised,  And to their foes a laughter; for in view  Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,  In posture to displode their second tire  Of thunder:  Back defeated to return  They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,  And to his mates thus in derision called.  O Friends! why come not on these victors proud  Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,  To entertain them fair with open front  And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms  Of composition, straight they changed their minds,  Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,  As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed  Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps  For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose,  If our proposals once again were heard,  We should compel them to a quick result.  To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.  Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,  Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;  Such as we might perceive amused them all,  And stumbled many:  Who receives them right,  Had need from head to foot well understand;  Not understood, this gift they have besides,  They show us when our foes walk not upright.  So they among themselves in pleasant vein  Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond  All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might  To match with their inventions they presumed  So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,  And all his host derided, while they stood  A while in trouble:  But they stood not long;  Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms  Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.  Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,  Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)  Their arms away they threw, and to the hills  (For Earth hath this variety from Heaven  Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)  Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;  From their foundations loosening to and fro,  They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,  Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops  Up-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze,  Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,  When coming towards them so dread they saw  The bottom of the mountains upward turned;  Till on those cursed engines' triple-row  They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence  Under the weight of mountains buried deep;  Themselves invaded next, and on their heads  Main promontories flung, which in the air  Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;  Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised  Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain  Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;  Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind  Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,  Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.  The rest, in imitation, to like arms  Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:  So hills amid the air encountered hills,  Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;  That under ground they fought in dismal shade;  Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game  To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped  Upon confusion rose:  And now all Heaven  Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;  Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits  Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,  Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen  This tumult, and permitted all, advised:  That his great purpose he might so fulfil,  To honour his anointed Son avenged  Upon his enemies, and to declare  All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son,  The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.  Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,  Son, in whose face invisible is beheld  Visibly, what by Deity I am;  And in whose hand what by decree I do,  Second Omnipotence! two days are past,  Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,  Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame  These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight,  As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;  For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,  Equal in their creation they were formed,  Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought  Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;  Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last  Endless, and no solution will be found:  War wearied hath performed what war can do,  And to disordered rage let loose the reins  With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes  Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.  Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;  For thee I have ordained it; and thus far  Have suffered, that the glory may be thine  Of ending this great war, since none but Thou  Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace  Immense I have transfused, that all may know  In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;  And, this perverse commotion governed thus,  To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir  Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King  By sacred unction, thy deserved right.  Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;  Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels  That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,  My bow and thunder, my almighty arms  Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;  Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out  From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:  There let them learn, as likes them, to despise  God, and Messiah his anointed King.  He said, and on his Son with rays direct  Shone full; he all his Father full expressed  Ineffably into his face received;  And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.  O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,  First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st  To glorify thy Son, I always thee,  As is most just:  This I my glory account,  My exaltation, and my whole delight,  That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will  Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.  Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,  And gladlier shall resign, when in the end  Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee  For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:  But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on  Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,  Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,  Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;  To their prepared ill mansion driven down,  To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;  That from thy just obedience could revolt,  Whom to obey is happiness entire.  Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure  Far separate, circling thy holy mount,  Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,  Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.  So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose  From the right hand of Glory where he sat;  And the third sacred morn began to shine,  Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound  The chariot of Paternal Deity,  Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,  Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed  By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each  Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all  And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels  Of beryl, and careering fires between;  Over their heads a crystal firmament,  Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure  Amber, and colours of the showery arch.  He, in celestial panoply all armed  Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,  Ascended; at his right hand Victory  Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow  And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;  And from about him fierce effusion rolled  Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:  Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,  He onward came; far off his coming shone;  And twenty thousand (I their number heard)  Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;  He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime  On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,  Illustrious far and wide; but by his own  First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,  When the great ensign of Messiah blazed  Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;  Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced  His army, circumfused on either wing,  Under their Head imbodied all in one.  Before him Power Divine his way prepared;  At his command the uprooted hills retired  Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went  Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,  And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.  This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,  And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,  Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.  In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?  But to convince the proud what signs avail,  Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?  They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,  Grieving to see his glory, at the sight  Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,  Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud  Weening to prosper, and at length prevail  Against God and Messiah, or to fall  In universal ruin last; and now  To final battle drew, disdaining flight,  Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God  To all his host on either hand thus spake.  Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,  Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:  Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God  Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;  And as ye have received, so have ye done,  Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew  The punishment to other hand belongs;  Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:  Number to this day's work is not ordained,  Nor multitude; stand only, and behold  God's indignation on these godless poured  By me; not you, but me, they have despised,  Yet envied; against me is all their rage,  Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme  Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,  Hath honoured me, according to his will.  Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;  That they may have their wish, to try with me  In battle which the stronger proves; they all,  Or I alone against them; since by strength  They measure all, of other excellence  Not emulous, nor care who them excels;  Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.  So spake the Son, and into terrour changed  His countenance too severe to be beheld,  And full of wrath bent on his enemies.  At once the Four spread out their starry wings  With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs  Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound  Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.  He on his impious foes right onward drove,  Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels  The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,  All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon  Among them he arrived; in his right hand  Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent  Before him, such as in their souls infixed  Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,  All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:  O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode  Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,  That wished the mountains now might be again  Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.  Nor less on either side tempestuous fell  His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four  Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;  One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye  Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire  Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,  And of their wonted vigour left them drained,  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked  His thunder in mid volley; for he meant  Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:  The overthrown he raised, and as a herd  Of goats or timorous flock together thronged  Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued  With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds  And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,  Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed  Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight  Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse  Urged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw  Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath  Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.  Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw  Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled  Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep  Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.  Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared,  And felt tenfold confusion in their fall  Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout  Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last  Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;  Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire  Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.  Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired  Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.  Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,  Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:  To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood  Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,  With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,  Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,  Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,  Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,  Worthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode  Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts  And temple of his Mighty Father throned  On high; who into glory him received,  Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.  Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,  At thy request, and that thou mayest beware  By what is past, to thee I have revealed  What might have else to human race been hid;  The discord which befel, and war in Heaven  Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall  Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled  With Satan; he who envies now thy state,  Who now is plotting how he may seduce  Thee also from obedience, that, with him  Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake  His punishment, eternal misery;  Which would be all his solace and revenge,  As a despite done against the Most High,  Thee once to gain companion of his woe.  But listen not to his temptations, warn  Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,  By terrible example, the reward  Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,  Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. \r\n                         \n", "Psalm 02": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Done Aug. 8. 1653.

If any ask for him, it shall be said,  \u201cHobson has supped, and \u2019s newly gone to bed.\u201d \r\n                         \n", "Paradise Regained: The Fourth Book": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Perplexed and troubled at his bad success The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, Discovered in his fraud, thrown from his hope So oft, and the persuasive rhetoric That sleeked his tongue, and won so much on Eve, So little here, nay lost.  But Eve was Eve; This far his over-match, who, self-deceived And rash, beforehand had no better weighed The strength he was to cope with, or his own. But\u2014as a man who had been matchless held                    In cunning, over-reached where least he thought, To salve his credit, and for very spite, Still will be tempting him who foils him still, And never cease, though to his shame the more; Or as a swarm of flies in vintage-time, About the wine-press where sweet must is poured, Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; Or surging waves against a solid rock, Though all to shivers dashed, the assault renew, (Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end\u2014                So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse Met ever, and to shameful silence brought, Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success, And his vain importunity pursues. He brought our Saviour to the western side Of that high mountain, whence he might behold Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide, Washed by the southern sea, and on the north To equal length backed with a ridge of hills That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men       From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst Divided by a river, off whose banks On each side an Imperial City stood, With towers and temples proudly elevate On seven small hills, with palaces adorned, Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts, Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs, Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes Above the highth of mountains interposed\u2014 By what strange parallax, or optic skill                     Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass Of telescope, were curious to enquire. And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:\u2014   \"The city which thou seest no other deem Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched Of nations.  There the Capitol thou seest, Above the rest lifting his stately head On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine,                       The imperial palace, compass huge, and high The structure, skill of noblest architects, With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires. Many a fair edifice besides, more like Houses of gods\u2014so well I have disposed My aerie microscope\u2014thou may'st behold, Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs Carved work, the hand of famed artificers In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold.                            Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see What conflux issuing forth, or entering in: Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces Hasting, or on return, in robes of state; Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power; Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings; Or embassies from regions far remote, In various habits, on the Appian road, Or on the AEmilian\u2014some from farthest south, Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,                  Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west, The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea; From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these), From India and the Golden Chersoness, And utmost Indian isle Taprobane, Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed; From Gallia, Gades, and the British west; Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool. All nations now to Rome obedience pay\u2014                      To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain, In ample territory, wealth and power, Civility of manners, arts and arms, And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer Before the Parthian.  These two thrones except, The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, Shared among petty kings too far removed; These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory. This Emperor hath no son, and now is old,                    Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired To Capreae, an island small but strong On the Campanian shore, with purpose there His horrid lusts in private to enjoy; Committing to a wicked favourite All public cares, and yet of him suspicious; Hated of all, and hating.  With what ease, Endued with regal virtues as thou art, Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne,            Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending, A victor-people free from servile yoke! And with my help thou may'st; to me the power Is given, and by that right I give it thee. Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world; Aim at the highest; without the highest attained, Will be for thee no sitting, or not long, On David's throne, be prophesied what will.\"   To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:\u2014 \"Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew                    Of luxury, though called magnificence, More than of arms before, allure mine eye, Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts On citron tables or Atlantic stone (For I have also heard, perhaps have read), Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold, Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems And studs of pearl\u2014to me should'st tell, who thirst         And hunger still.  Then embassies thou shew'st From nations far and nigh!  What honour that, But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear So many hollow compliments and lies, Outlandish flatteries?  Then proceed'st to talk Of the Emperor, how easily subdued, How gloriously.  I shall, thou say'st, expel A brutish monster: what if I withal Expel a Devil who first made him such? Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out;                 For him I was not sent, nor yet to free That people, victor once, now vile and base, Deservedly made vassal\u2014who, once just, Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well, But govern ill the nations under yoke, Peeling their provinces, exhausted all By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown Of triumph, that insulting vanity; Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed;               Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still, And from the daily Scene effeminate. What wise and valiant man would seek to free These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved, Or could of inward slaves make outward free? Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit On David's throne, it shall be like a tree Spreading and overshadowing all the earth, Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash All monarchies besides throughout the world;                 And of my Kingdom there shall be no end. Means there shall be to this; but what the means Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell.\"   To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:\u2014 \"I see all offers made by me how slight Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st. Nothing will please the difficult and nice, Or nothing more than still to contradict. On the other side know also thou that I On what I offer set as high esteem,                          Nor what I part with mean to give for naught, All these, which in a moment thou behold'st, The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give (For, given to me, I give to whom I please), No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else\u2014 On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, And worship me as thy superior Lord (Easily done), and hold them all of me; For what can less so great a gift deserve?\"   Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:\u2014             \"I never liked thy talk, thy offers less; Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter The abominable terms, impious condition. But I endure the time, till which expired Thou hast permission on me.  It is written, The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.' And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve,                   And more blasphemous; which expect to rue. The kingdoms of the world to thee were given! Permitted rather, and by thee usurped; Other donation none thou canst produce. If given, by whom but by the King of kings, God over all supreme?  If given to thee, By thee how fairly is the Giver now Repaid!  But gratitude in thee is lost Long since.  Wert thou so void of fear or shame As offer them to me, the Son of God\u2014                        To me my own, on such abhorred pact, That I fall down and worship thee as God? Get thee behind me!  Plain thou now appear'st That Evil One, Satan for ever damned.\"   To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:\u2014 \"Be not so sore offended, Son of God\u2014 Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men\u2014 If I, to try whether in higher sort Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed What both from Men and Angels I receive,                     Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth Nations besides from all the quartered winds\u2014 God of this World invoked, and World beneath. Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold To me most fatal, me it most concerns. The trial hath indamaged thee no way, Rather more honour left and more esteem; Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed. Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more                  Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not. And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined Than to a worldly crown, addicted more To contemplation and profound dispute; As by that early action may be judged, When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st Alone into the Temple, there wast found Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant On points and questions fitting Moses' chair, Teaching, not taught.  The childhood shews the man,          As morning shews the day.  Be famous, then, By wisdom; as thy empire must extend, So let extend thy mind o'er all the world In knowledge; all things in it comprehend. All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law, The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote; The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach To admiration, led by Nature's light; And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st.                  Without their learning, how wilt thou with them, Or they with thee, hold conversation meet? How wilt thou reason with them, how refute Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes? Error by his own arms is best evinced. Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount, Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold Where on the AEgean shore a city stands, Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil\u2014 Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts                    And Eloquence, native to famous wits Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, City or suburban, studious walks and shades. See there the olive-grove of Academe, Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long; There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls His whispering stream.  Within the walls then view           The schools of ancient sages\u2014his who bred Great Alexander to subdue the world, Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next. There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit By voice or hand, and various-measured verse, AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes, And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called, Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.                   Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught In chorus or iambic, teachers best Of moral prudence, with delight received In brief sententious precepts, while they treat Of fate, and chance, and change in human life, High actions and high passions best describing. Thence to the famous Orators repair, Those ancient whose resistless eloquence Wielded at will that fierce democraty, Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece                  To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne. To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, From heaven descended to the low-roofed house Of Socrates\u2014see there his tenement\u2014 Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools Of Academics old and new, with those Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.                             These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home, Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight; These rules will render thee a king complete Within thyself, much more with empire joined.\"   To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:\u2014 \"Think not but that I know these things; or, think I know them not, not therefore am I short Of knowing what I ought.  He who receives Light from above, from the Fountain of Light, No other doctrine needs, though granted true;                But these are false, or little else but dreams, Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. The first and wisest of them all professed To know this only, that he nothing knew; The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits; A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense; Others in virtue placed felicity, But virtue joined with riches and long life; In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease; The Stoic last in philosophic pride,                         By him called virtue, and his virtuous man, Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing, Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, As fearing God nor man, contemning all Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life\u2014 Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can; For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead, Ignorant of themselves, of God much more,                    And how the World began, and how Man fell, Degraded by himself, on grace depending? Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry; And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves All glory arrogate, to God give none; Rather accuse him under usual names, Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite Of mortal things.  Who, therefore, seeks in these True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,                 An empty cloud.  However, many books, Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads Incessantly, and to his reading brings not A spirit and judgment equal or superior, (And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?) Uncertain and unsettled still remains, Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself, Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge, As children gathering pebbles on the shore.                  Or, if I would delight my private hours With music or with poem, where so soon As in our native language can I find That solace?  All our Law and Story strewed With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed, Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon That pleased so well our victor's ear, declare That rather Greece from us these arts derived\u2014 Ill imitated while they loudest sing The vices of their deities, and their own,                   In fable, hymn, or song, so personating Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid As varnish on a harlot's cheek, the rest, Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight, Will far be found unworthy to compare With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling, Where God is praised aright and godlike men, The Holiest of Holies and his Saints (Such are from God inspired, not such from thee);            Unless where moral virtue is expressed By light of Nature, not in all quite lost. Their orators thou then extoll'st as those The top of eloquence\u2014statists indeed, And lovers of their country, as may seem; But herein to our Prophets far beneath, As men divinely taught, and better teaching The solid rules of civil government, In their majestic, unaffected style, Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome.                     In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so, What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat; These only, with our Law, best form a king.\"   So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent), Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:\u2014   \"Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts, Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught By me proposed in life contemplative                         Or active, tended on by glory or fame, What dost thou in this world?  The Wilderness For thee is fittest place: I found thee there, And thither will return thee.  Yet remember What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid, Which would have set thee in short time with ease On David's throne, or throne of all the world, Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,                When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled. Now, contrary\u2014if I read aught in heaven, Or heaven write aught of fate\u2014by what the stars Voluminous, or single characters In their conjunction met, give me to spell, Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate, Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries, Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death. A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom, Real or allegoric, I discern not;                            Nor when: eternal sure\u2014as without end, Without beginning; for no date prefixed Directs me in the starry rubric set.\"   So saying, he took (for still he knew his power Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there, Feigning to disappear.  Darkness now rose, As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night, Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both, Privation mere of light and absent day.                      Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore, Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest, Wherever, under some concourse of shades, Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield From dews and damps of night his sheltered head; But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams Disturbed his sleep.  And either tropic now 'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds            From many a horrid rift abortive poured Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire, In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad From the four hinges of the world, and fell On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines, Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks, Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, Or torn up sheer.  Ill wast thou shrouded then, O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st                      Unshaken!  Nor yet staid the terror there: Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked, Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace. Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey, Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds, And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised             To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. And now the sun with more effectual beams Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds, Who all things now behold more fresh and green, After a night of storm so ruinous, Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray, To gratulate the sweet return of morn. Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn, Was absent, after all his mischief done,                     The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came; Yet with no new device (they all were spent), Rather by this his last affront resolved, Desperate of better course, to vent his rage And mad despite to be so oft repelled. Him walking on a sunny hill he found, Backed on the north and west by a thick wood; Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape, And in a careless mood thus to him said:\u2014                     \"Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God, After a dismal night.  I heard the wrack, As earth and sky would mingle; but myself Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them, As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven, Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath, Are to the main as inconsiderable And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze To man's less universe, and soon are gone. Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light              On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent, Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point, They oft fore-signify and threaten ill. This tempest at this desert most was bent; Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject The perfect season offered with my aid To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong All to the push of fate, pursue thy way                      Of gaining David's throne no man knows when (For both the when and how is nowhere told), Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt; For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing The time and means?  Each act is rightliest done Not when it must, but when it may be best. If thou observe not this, be sure to find What I foretold thee\u2014many a hard assay Of dangers, and adversities, and pains, Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;                  Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round, So many terrors, voices, prodigies, May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign.\"   So talked he, while the Son of God went on, And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:\u2014   \"Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none. I never feared they could, though noising loud And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs Betokening or ill-boding I contemn                           As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing, Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting, At least might seem to hold all power of thee, Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God; And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify Me to thy will!  Desist (thou art discerned, And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest.\"   To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:\u2014 \"Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!                     For Son of God to me is yet in doubt. Of the Messiah I have heard foretold By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew, And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field, On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. From that time seldom have I ceased to eye Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all                     Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest (Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved. Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn In what degree or meaning thou art called The Son of God, which bears no single sense. The Son of God I also am, or was; And, if I was, I am; relation stands: All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought                  In some respect far higher so declared. Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour, And followed thee still on to this waste wild, Where, by all best conjectures, I collect Thou art to be my fatal enemy. Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek To understand my adversary, who And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent; By parle or composition, truce or league, To win him, or win from him what I can.                      And opportunity I here have had To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee Proof against all temptation, as a rock Of adamant and as a centre, firm To the utmost of mere man both wise and good, Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory, Have been before contemned, and may again. Therefore, to know what more thou art than man, Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven, Another method I must now begin.\"                              So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime, Over the wilderness and o'er the plain, Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, The Holy City, lifted high her towers, And higher yet the glorious Temple reared Her pile, far off appearing like a mount Of alablaster, topt with golden spires: There, on the highest pinnacle, he set The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:\u2014                     \"There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright Will ask thee skill.  I to thy Father's house Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best. Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand, Cast thyself down.  Safely, if Son of God; For it is written, 'He will give command Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands They shall uplift thee, lest at any time Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'\"   To whom thus Jesus: \"Also it is written,                   'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'\"  He said, and stood; But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell. As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose, Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined, Throttled at length in the air expired and fell, So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud, Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride                    Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall; And, as that Theban monster that proposed Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured, That once found out and solved, for grief and spite Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep, So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend, And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought Joyless triumphals of his hoped success, Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.                   So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, Who on their plumy vans received Him soft From his uneasy station, and upbore, As on a floating couch, through the blithe air; Then, in a flowery valley, set him down On a green bank, and set before him spread A table of celestial food, divine Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life, And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,                  That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired, Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires Sung heavenly anthems of his victory Over temptation and the Tempter proud:\u2014   \"True Image of the Father, whether throned In the bosom of bliss, and light of light Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined In fleshly tabernacle and human form, Wandering the wilderness\u2014whatever place,                    Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing The Son of God, with Godlike force endued Against the attempter of thy Father's throne And thief of Paradise!  Him long of old Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast With all his army; now thou hast avenged Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise, And frustrated the conquest fraudulent. He never more henceforth will dare set foot                  In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke. For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed, A fairer Paradise is founded now For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou, A Saviour, art come down to reinstall; Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be, Of tempter and temptation without fear. But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long Rule in the clouds.  Like an autumnal star, Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down         Under his feet.  For proof, ere this thou feel'st Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound) By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues Thy bold attempt.  Hereafter learn with awe To dread the Son of God.  He, all unarmed, Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice, From thy demoniac holds, possession foul\u2014 Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly, And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,                     Lest he command them down into the Deep, Bound, and to torment sent before their time. Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds, Queller of Satan!  On thy glorious work Now enter, and begin to save Mankind.\"   Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek, Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed, Brought on his way with joy.  He, unobserved, Home to his mother's house private returned.

II  For now to sorrow must I tune my song,  And set my Harp to notes of saddest woe,  Which on our dearest Lord did seize ere long,  Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse than so,  Which he for us did freely undergo:  Most perfect Hero, tried in heaviest plight  Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight!   III  He, sovran Priest, stooping his regal head,  That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,  Poor fleshly Tabernacle enter\u00e8d,  His starry front low-roofed beneath the skies:  Oh, what a mask was there, what a disguise!  Yet more: the stroke of death he must abide;  Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethren\u2019s side.   IV  These latest scenes confine my roving verse;  To this horizon is my Ph\u0153bus bound.  His godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,  And former sufferings, otherwhere are found;  Loud o\u2019er the rest Cremona\u2019s trump doth sound:  Me softer airs befit, and softer strings  Of lute, or viol still, more apt for mournful things.   V  Befriend me, Night, best Patroness of grief!  Over the pole thy thickest mantle throw,  And work my flattered fancy to belief  That Heaven and Earth are coloured with my woe;  My sorrows are too dark for day to know:  The leaves should all be black whereon I write,  And letters, where my tears have washed, a wannish white.   VI  See, see the chariot, and those rushing wheels,  That whirled the prophet up at Chebar flood;  My spirit some transporting Cherub feels  To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,  Once glorious towers, now sunk in guiltless blood.  There doth my soul in holy vision sit,  In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatic fit.   VII  Mine eye hath found that sad sepulchral rock  That was the casket of Heaven\u2019s richest store,  And here, though grief my feeble hands up-lock, Yet on the softened quarry would I score  My plaining verse as lively as before;  For sure so well instructed are my tears  That they would fitly fall in ordered characters.   VIII  Or, should I thence, hurried on viewless wing, Take up a weeping on the mountains wild,  The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring  Would soon unbosom all their Echoes mild;  And I (for grief is easily beguiled)  Might think the infection of my sorrows loud  Had got a race of mourners on some pregnant cloud.

Awake,  My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,  Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!  Awake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field  Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring  Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,  What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,  How nature paints her colours, how the bee  Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.  Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye  On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.  O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,  My glory, my perfection! glad I see  Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night  (Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,  If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,  Works of day past, or morrow's next design,  But of offence and trouble, which my mind  Knew never till this irksome night:  Methought,  Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk  With gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,  'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,  'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields  'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake  'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns  'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light  'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,  'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,  'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?  'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment  'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'  I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;  To find thee I directed then my walk;  And on, methought, alone I passed through ways  That brought me on a sudden to the tree  Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,  Much fairer to my fancy than by day:  And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood  One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven  By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled  Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;  And 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,  'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,  'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?  'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?  'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold  'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?  This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm  He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled  At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:  But he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,  'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,  'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit  'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:  'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more  'Communicated, more abundant grows,  'The author not impaired, but honoured more?  'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!  'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,  'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:  'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods  'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,  'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes  'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see  'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'  So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,  Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part  Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell  So quickened appetite, that I, methought,  Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds  With him I flew, and underneath beheld  The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide  And various:  Wondering at my flight and change  To this high exaltation; suddenly  My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,  And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked  To find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night  Related, and thus Adam answered sad.  Best image of myself, and dearer half,  The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep  Affects me equally; nor can I like  This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;  Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,  Created pure.  But know that in the soul  Are many lesser faculties, that serve  Reason as chief; among these Fancy next  Her office holds; of all external things  Which the five watchful senses represent,  She forms imaginations, aery shapes,  Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames  All what we affirm or what deny, and call  Our knowledge or opinion; then retires  Into her private cell, when nature rests.  Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes  To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,  Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;  Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.  Some such resemblances, methinks, I find  Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,  But with addition strange; yet be not sad.  Evil into the mind of God or Man  May come and go, so unreproved, and leave  No spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope  That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,  Waking thou never will consent to do.  Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,  That wont to be more cheerful and serene,  Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;  And let us to our fresh employments rise  Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers  That open now their choisest bosomed smells,  Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.  So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;  But silently a gentle tear let fall  From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;  Two other precious drops that ready stood,  Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell  Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse  And pious awe, that feared to have offended.  So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.  But first, from under shady arborous roof  Soon as they forth were come to open sight  Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,  With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,  Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,  Discovering in wide landskip all the east  Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains,  Lowly they bowed adoring, and began  Their orisons, each morning duly paid  In various style; for neither various style  Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise  Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung  Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence  Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,  More tuneable than needed lute or harp  To add more sweetness; and they thus began.  These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,  Almighty!  Thine this universal frame,  Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!  Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens  To us invisible, or dimly seen  In these thy lowest works; yet these declare  Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.  Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,  Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs  And choral symphonies, day without night,  Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven  On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol  Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.  Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,  If better thou belong not to the dawn,  Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn  With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,  While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.  Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,  Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise  In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,  And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.  Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,  With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;  And ye five other wandering Fires, that move  In mystick dance not without song, resound  His praise, who out of darkness called up light.  Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth  Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run  Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix  And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change  Vary to our great Maker still new praise.  Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise  From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,  Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,  In honour to the world's great Author rise;  Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,  Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,  Rising or falling still advance his praise.  His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,  Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,  With every plant, in sign of worship wave.  Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,  Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.  Join voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,  That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,  Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.  Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk  The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;  Witness if I be silent, morn or even,  To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,  Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.  Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still  To give us only good; and if the night  Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,  Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!  So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts  Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.  On to their morning's rural work they haste,  Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row  Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far  Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check  Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine  To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines  Her marriageable arms, and with him brings  Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn  His barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld  With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called  Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned  To travel with Tobias, and secured  His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.  Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth  Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,  Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed  This night the human pair; how he designs  In them at once to ruin all mankind.  Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend  Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade  Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,  To respite his day-labour with repast,  Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,  As may advise him of his happy state,  Happiness in his power left free to will,  Left to his own free will, his will though free,  Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware  He swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal  His danger, and from whom; what enemy,  Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now  The fall of others from like state of bliss;  By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;  But by deceit and lies:  This let him know,  Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend  Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.  So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled  All justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint  After his charge received; but from among  Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood  Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,  Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,  On each hand parting, to his speed gave way  Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate  Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide  On golden hinges turning, as by work  Divine the sovran Architect had framed.  From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,  Star interposed, however small he sees,  Not unconformed to other shining globes,  Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned  Above all hills.  As when by night the glass  Of Galileo, less assured, observes  Imagined lands and regions in the moon:  Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades  Delos or Samos first appearing, kens  A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight  He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky  Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing  Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan  Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar  Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems  A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,  When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's  Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.  At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise  He lights, and to his proper shape returns  A Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade  His lineaments divine; the pair that clad  Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast  With regal ornament; the middle pair  Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round  Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold  And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet  Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,  Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,  And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled  The circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands  Of Angels under watch; and to his state,  And to his message high, in honour rise;  For on some message high they guessed him bound.  Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come  Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,  And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;  A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here  Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will  Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,  Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.  Him through the spicy forest onward come  Adam discerned, as in the door he sat  Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun  Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm  Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:  And Eve within, due at her hour prepared  For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please  True appetite, and not disrelish thirst  Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,  Berry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.  Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold  Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape  Comes this way moving; seems another morn  Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven  To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe  This day to be our guest.  But go with speed,  And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour  Abundance, fit to honour and receive  Our heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford  Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow  From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies  Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows  More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.  To whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,  Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,  All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;  Save what by frugal storing firmness gains  To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:  But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,  Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice  To entertain our Angel-guest, as he  Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth  God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.  So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste  She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent  What choice to choose for delicacy best,  What order, so contrived as not to mix  Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring  Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;  Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk  Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields  In India East or West, or middle shore  In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where  Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat  Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,  She gathers, tribute large, and on the board  Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape  She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths  From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed  She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold  Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground  With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.  Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet  His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train  Accompanied than with his own complete  Perfections; in himself was all his state,  More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits  On princes, when their rich retinue long  Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,  Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.  Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed,  Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,  As to a superiour nature bowing low,  Thus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place  None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;  Since, by descending from the thrones above,  Those happy places thou hast deigned a while  To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us  Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess  This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower  To rest; and what the garden choicest bears  To sit and taste, till this meridian heat  Be over, and the sun more cool decline.  Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.  Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such  Created, or such place hast here to dwell,  As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,  To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower  O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,  I have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge  They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,  With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,  Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair  Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned  Of three that in mount Ida naked strove,  Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil  She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm  Altered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail  Bestowed, the holy salutation used  Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.  Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb  Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,  Than with these various fruits the trees of God  Have heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf  Their table was, and mossy seats had round,  And on her ample square from side to side  All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here  Danced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;  No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began  Our author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste  These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom  All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,  To us for food and for delight hath caused  The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps  To spiritual natures; only this I know,  That one celestial Father gives to all.  To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives  (Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part  Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found  No ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure  Intelligential substances require,  As doth your rational; and both contain  Within them every lower faculty  Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,  Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,  And corporeal to incorporeal turn.  For know, whatever was created, needs  To be sustained and fed:  Of elements  The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,  Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires  Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;  Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged  Vapours not yet into her substance turned.  Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale  From her moist continent to higher orbs.  The sun that light imparts to all, receives  From all his alimental recompence  In humid exhalations, and at even  Sups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees  Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines  Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn  We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground  Covered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here  Varied his bounty so with new delights,  As may compare with Heaven; and to taste  Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,  And to their viands fell; nor seemingly  The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss  Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch  Of real hunger, and concoctive heat  To transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires  Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire  Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist  Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,  Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,  As from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve  Ministered naked, and their flowing cups  With pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence  Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,  Then had the sons of God excuse to have been  Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts  Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy  Was understood, the injured lover's hell.  Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,  Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose  In Adam, not to let the occasion pass  Given him by this great conference to know  Of things above his world, and of their being  Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw  Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,  Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far  Exceeded human; and his wary speech  Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.  Inhabitant with God, now know I well  Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;  Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed  To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,  Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,  As that more willingly thou couldst not seem  At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare  To whom the winged Hierarch replied.  O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom  All things proceed, and up to him return,  If not depraved from good, created all  Such to perfection, one first matter all,  Endued with various forms, various degrees  Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;  But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,  As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending  Each in their several active spheres assigned,  Till body up to spirit work, in bounds  Proportioned to each kind.  So from the root  Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves  More aery, last the bright consummate flower  Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,  Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,  To vital spirits aspire, to animal,  To intellectual; give both life and sense,  Fancy and understanding; whence the soul  Reason receives, and reason is her being,  Discursive, or intuitive; discourse  Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,  Differing but in degree, of kind the same.  Wonder not then, what God for you saw good  If I refuse not, but convert, as you  To proper substance.  Time may come, when Men  With Angels may participate, and find  No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;  And from these corporal nutriments perhaps  Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,  Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend  Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,  Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;  If ye be found obedient, and retain  Unalterably firm his love entire,  Whose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy  Your fill what happiness this happy state  Can comprehend, incapable of more.  To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.  O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,  Well hast thou taught the way that might direct  Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set  From center to circumference; whereon,  In contemplation of created things,  By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,  What meant that caution joined, If ye be found  Obedient?  Can we want obedience then  To him, or possibly his love desert,  Who formed us from the dust and placed us here  Full to the utmost measure of what bliss  Human desires can seek or apprehend?  To whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,  Attend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;  That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,  That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.  This was that caution given thee; be advised.  God made thee perfect, not immutable;  And good he made thee, but to persevere  He left it in thy power; ordained thy will  By nature free, not over-ruled by fate  Inextricable, or strict necessity:  Our voluntary service he requires,  Not our necessitated; such with him  Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how  Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve  Willing or no, who will but what they must  By destiny, and can no other choose?  Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand  In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state  Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;  On other surety none:  Freely we serve,  Because we freely love, as in our will  To love or not; in this we stand or fall:  And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,  And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall  From what high state of bliss, into what woe!  To whom our great progenitor.  Thy words  Attentive, and with more delighted ear,  Divine instructer, I have heard, than when  Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills  Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not  To be both will and deed created free;  Yet that we never shall forget to love  Our Maker, and obey him whose command  Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts  Assured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest  Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,  But more desire to hear, if thou consent,  The full relation, which must needs be strange,  Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;  And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun  Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins  His other half in the great zone of Heaven.  Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,  After short pause assenting, thus began.  High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,  Sad task and hard:  For how shall I relate  To human sense the invisible exploits  Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,  The ruin of so many glorious once  And perfect while they stood? how last unfold  The secrets of another world, perhaps  Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good  This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach  Of human sense, I shall delineate so,  By likening spiritual to corporal forms,  As may express them best; though what if Earth  Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein  Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?  As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild  Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests  Upon her center poised; when on a day  (For time, though in eternity, applied  To motion, measures all things durable  By present, past, and future,) on such day  As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host  Of Angels by imperial summons called,  Innumerable before the Almighty's throne  Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared  Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:  Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,  Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear  Stream in the air, and for distinction serve  Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;  Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed  Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love  Recorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs  Of circuit inexpressible they stood,  Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,  By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,  Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top  Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.  Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;  Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.  This day I have begot whom I declare  My only Son, and on this holy hill  Him have anointed, whom ye now behold  At my right hand; your head I him appoint;  And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow  All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:  Under his great vice-gerent reign abide  United, as one individual soul,  For ever happy:  Him who disobeys,  Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,  Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls  Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place  Ordained without redemption, without end.  So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words  All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.  That day, as other solemn days, they spent  In song and dance about the sacred hill;  Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere  Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels  Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,  Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular  Then most, when most irregular they seem;  And in their motions harmony divine  So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear  Listens delighted.  Evening now approached,  (For we have also our evening and our morn,  We ours for change delectable, not need;)  Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn  Desirous; all in circles as they stood,  Tables are set, and on a sudden piled  With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows  In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,  Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.  On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,  They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet  Quaff immortality and joy, secure  Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds  Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered  With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.  Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled  From that high mount of God, whence light and shade  Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed  To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there  In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed  All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;  Wide over all the plain, and wider far  Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,  (Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,  Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend  By living streams among the trees of life,  Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,  Celestial tabernacles, where they slept  Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,  Melodious hymns about the sovran throne  Alternate all night long: but not so waked  Satan; so call him now, his former name  Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,  If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,  In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught  With envy against the Son of God, that day  Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed  Messiah King anointed, could not bear  Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.  Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,  Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour  Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved  With all his legions to dislodge, and leave  Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,  Contemptuous; and his next subordinate  Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.  Sleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close  Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree  Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips  Of Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts  Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;  Both waking we were one; how then can now  Thy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;  New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise  In us who serve, new counsels to debate  What doubtful may ensue:  More in this place  To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou  Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;  Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night  Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,  And all who under me their banners wave,  Homeward, with flying march, where we possess  The quarters of the north; there to prepare  Fit entertainment to receive our King,  The great Messiah, and his new commands,  Who speedily through all the hierarchies  Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.  So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused  Bad influence into the unwary breast  Of his associate:  He together calls,  Or several one by one, the regent Powers,  Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,  That the Most High commanding, now ere night,  Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,  The great hierarchal standard was to move;  Tells the suggested cause, and casts between  Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound  Or taint integrity:  But all obeyed  The wonted signal, and superiour voice  Of their great Potentate; for great indeed  His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;  His countenance, as the morning-star that guides  The starry flock, allured them, and with lies  Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host.  Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns  Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,  And from within the golden lamps that burn  Nightly before him, saw without their light  Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread  Among the sons of morn, what multitudes  Were banded to oppose his high decree;  And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.  Son, thou in whom my glory I behold  In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,  Nearly it now concerns us to be sure  Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms  We mean to hold what anciently we claim  Of deity or empire:  Such a foe  Is rising, who intends to erect his throne  Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;  Nor so content, hath in his thought to try  In battle, what our power is, or our right.  Let us advise, and to this hazard draw  With speed what force is left, and all employ  In our defence; lest unawares we lose  This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.  To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,  Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,  Made answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes  Justly hast in derision, and, secure,  Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,  Matter to me of glory, whom their hate  Illustrates, when they see all regal power  Given me to quell their pride, and in event  Know whether I be dextrous to subdue  Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.  So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,  Far was advanced on winged speed; an host  Innumerable as the stars of night,  Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun  Impearls on every leaf and every flower.  Regions they passed, the mighty regencies  Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,  In their triple degrees; regions to which  All thy dominion, Adam, is no more  Than what this garden is to all the earth,  And all the sea, from one entire globose  Stretched into longitude; which having passed,  At length into the limits of the north  They came; and Satan to his royal seat  High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount  Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers  From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;  The palace of great Lucifer, (so call  That structure in the dialect of men  Interpreted,) which not long after, he  Affecting all equality with God,  In imitation of that mount whereon  Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,  The Mountain of the Congregation called;  For thither he assembled all his train,  Pretending so commanded to consult  About the great reception of their King,  Thither to come, and with calumnious art  Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;  If these magnifick titles yet remain  Not merely titular, since by decree  Another now hath to himself engrossed  All power, and us eclipsed under the name  Of King anointed, for whom all this haste  Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,  This only to consult how we may best,  With what may be devised of honours new,  Receive him coming to receive from us  Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!  Too much to one! but double how endured,  To one, and to his image now proclaimed?  But what if better counsels might erect  Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?  Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend  The supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust  To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves  Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before  By none; and if not equal all, yet free,  Equally free; for orders and degrees  Jar not with liberty, but well consist.  Who can in reason then, or right, assume  Monarchy over such as live by right  His equals, if in power and splendour less,  In freedom equal? or can introduce  Law and edict on us, who without law  Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,  And look for adoration, to the abuse  Of those imperial titles, which assert  Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.  Thus far his bold discourse without controul  Had audience; when among the Seraphim  Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored  The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,  Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe  The current of his fury thus opposed.  O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!  Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven  Expected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,  In place thyself so high above thy peers.  Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn  The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,  That to his only Son, by right endued  With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven  Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due  Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,  Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,  And equal over equals to let reign,  One over all with unsucceeded power.  Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute  With him the points of liberty, who made  Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven  Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?  Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,  And of our good and of our dignity  How provident he is; how far from thought  To make us less, bent rather to exalt  Our happy state, under one head more near  United.  But to grant it thee unjust,  That equal over equals monarch reign:  Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,  Or all angelick nature joined in one,  Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,  As by his Word, the Mighty Father made  All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven  By him created in their bright degrees,  Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,  Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,  But more illustrious made; since he the head  One of our number thus reduced becomes;  His laws our laws; all honour to him done  Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,  And tempt not these; but hasten to appease  The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,  While pardon may be found in time besought.  So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal  None seconded, as out of season judged,  Or singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced  The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.  That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work  Of secondary hands, by task transferred  From Father to his Son? strange point and new!  Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw  When this creation was? rememberest thou  Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?  We know no time when we were not as now;  Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised  By our own quickening power, when fatal course  Had circled his full orb, the birth mature  Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.  Our puissance is our own; our own right hand  Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try  Who is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold  Whether by supplication we intend  Address, and to begirt the almighty throne  Beseeching or besieging.  This report,  These tidings carry to the anointed King;  And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.  He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,  Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause  Through the infinite host; nor less for that  The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone  Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.  O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,  Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall  Determined, and thy hapless crew involved  In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread  Both of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth  No more be troubled how to quit the yoke  Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws  Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees  Against thee are gone forth without recall;  That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,  Is now an iron rod to bruise and break  Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;  Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly  These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath  Impendent, raging into sudden flame,  Distinguish not:  For soon expect to feel  His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.  Then who created thee lamenting learn,  When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.  So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found  Among the faithless, faithful only he;  Among innumerable false, unmoved,  Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,  His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;  Nor number, nor example, with him wrought  To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,  Though single.  From amidst them forth he passed,  Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained  Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;  And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned  On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed. \r\n                         \n", "An Epitaph On The Marchioness Of Winchester": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        This rich Marble doth enterr The honour'd Wife of Winchester, A Vicounts daughter, an Earls heir, Besides what her vertues fair Added to her noble birth, More then she could own from Earth.

Yet had the number of her days Bin as compleat as was her praise, Nature and fate had had no strife In giving limit to her life. Her high birth, and her graces sweet, Quickly found a lover meet; The Virgin quire for her request The God that sits at marriage feast; He at their invoking came But with a scarce-wel-lighted flame;                                  And in his Garland as he stood, Ye might discern a Cipress bud.

What thanks sufficient, or what recompence  Equal, have I to render thee, divine  Historian, who thus largely hast allayed  The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed  This friendly condescension to relate  Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard  With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,  With glory attributed to the high  Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains,  Which only thy solution can resolve.  When I behold this goodly frame, this world,  Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute  Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,  An atom, with the firmament compared  And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll  Spaces incomprehensible, (for such  Their distance argues, and their swift return  Diurnal,) merely to officiate light  Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,  One day and night; in all her vast survey  Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,  How Nature wise and frugal could commit  Such disproportions, with superfluous hand  So many nobler bodies to create,  Greater so manifold, to this one use,  For aught appears, and on their orbs impose  Such restless revolution day by day  Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,  That better might with far less compass move,  Served by more noble than herself, attains  Her end without least motion, and receives,  As tribute, such a sumless journey brought  Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;  Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.  So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed  Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve  Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,  With lowliness majestick from her seat,  And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,  Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,  To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,  Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,  And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.  Yet went she not, as not with such discourse  Delighted, or not capable her ear  Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,  Adam relating, she sole auditress;  Her husband the relater she preferred  Before the Angel, and of him to ask  Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix  Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute  With conjugal caresses: from his lip  Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now  Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?  With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,  Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,  A pomp of winning Graces waited still,  And from about her shot darts of desire  Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.  And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed,  Benevolent and facile thus replied.  To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven  Is as the book of God before thee set,  Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn  His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:  This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,  Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest  From Man or Angel the great Architect  Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge  His secrets to be scanned by them who ought  Rather admire; or, if they list to try  Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens  Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move  His laughter at their quaint opinions wide  Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven  And calculate the stars, how they will wield  The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive  To save appearances; how gird the sphere  With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er,  Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:  Already by thy reasoning this I guess,  Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest  That bodies bright and greater should not serve  The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,  Earth sitting still, when she alone receives  The benefit:  Consider first, that great  Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth  Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,  Nor glistering, may of solid good contain  More plenty than the sun that barren shines;  Whose virtue on itself works no effect,  But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,  His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.  Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries  Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant.  And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak  The Maker's high magnificence, who built  So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;  That Man may know he dwells not in his own;  An edifice too large for him to fill,  Lodged in a small partition; and the rest  Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.  The swiftness of those circles attribute,  Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,  That to corporeal substances could add  Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow,  Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven  Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived  In Eden; distance inexpressible  By numbers that have name.  But this I urge,  Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show  Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;  Not that I so affirm, though so it seem  To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.  God, to remove his ways from human sense,  Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,  If it presume, might err in things too high,  And no advantage gain.  What if the sun  Be center to the world; and other stars,  By his attractive virtue and their own  Incited, dance about him various rounds?  Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,  Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,  In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these  The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,  Insensibly three different motions move?  Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,  Moved contrary with thwart obliquities;  Or save the sun his labour, and that swift  Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,  Invisible else above all stars, the wheel  Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,  If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day  Travelling east, and with her part averse  From the sun's beam meet night, her other part  Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light,  Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,  To the terrestrial moon be as a star,  Enlightening her by day, as she by night  This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,  Fields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest  As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce  Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat  Allotted there; and other suns perhaps,  With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,  Communicating male and female light;  Which two great sexes animate the world,  Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.  For such vast room in Nature unpossessed  By living soul, desart and desolate,  Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute  Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far  Down to this habitable, which returns  Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.  But whether thus these things, or whether not;  But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,  Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;  He from the east his flaming road begin;  Or she from west her silent course advance,  With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps  On her soft axle, while she paces even,  And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along;  Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;  Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!  Of other creatures, as him pleases best,  Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou  In what he gives to thee, this Paradise  And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high  To know what passes there; be lowly wise:  Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;  Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there  Live, in what state, condition, or degree;  Contented that thus far hath been revealed  Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.  To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.  How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure  Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!  And, freed from intricacies, taught to live  The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts  To interrupt the sweet of life, from which  God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,  And not molest us; unless we ourselves  Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.  But apt the mind or fancy is to rove  Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;  Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,  That, not to know at large of things remote  From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know  That which before us lies in daily life,  Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume,  Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:  And renders us, in things that most concern,  Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.  Therefore from this high pitch let us descend  A lower flight, and speak of things at hand  Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise  Of something not unseasonable to ask,  By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.  Thee I have heard relating what was done  Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate  My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;  And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest  How subtly to detain thee I devise;  Inviting thee to hear while I relate;  Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:  For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;  And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear  Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst  And hunger both, from labour, at the hour  Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,  Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine  Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.  To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.  Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,  Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee  Abundantly his gifts hath also poured  Inward and outward both, his image fair:  Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace  Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;  Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth  Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire  Gladly into the ways of God with Man:  For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set  On Man his equal love:  Say therefore on;  For I that day was absent, as befel,  Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,  Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;  Squared in full legion (such command we had)  To see that none thence issued forth a spy,  Or enemy, while God was in his work;  Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,  Destruction with creation might have mixed.  Not that they durst without his leave attempt;  But us he sends upon his high behests  For state, as Sovran King; and to inure  Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut,  The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;  But long ere our approaching heard within  Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,  Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.  Glad we returned up to the coasts of light  Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.  But thy relation now; for I attend,  Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.  So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.  For Man to tell how human life began  Is hard; for who himself beginning knew  Desire with thee still longer to converse  Induced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep,  Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,  In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun  Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.  Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,  And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised  By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,  As thitherward endeavouring, and upright  Stood on my feet: about me round I saw  Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,  And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,  Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;  Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;  With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.  Myself I then perused, and limb by limb  Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran  With supple joints, as lively vigour led:  But who I was, or where, or from what cause,  Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;  My tongue obeyed, and readily could name  Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light,  And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,  Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,  And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,  Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?--  Not of myself;--by some great Maker then,  In goodness and in power pre-eminent:  Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,  From whom I have that thus I move and live,  And feel that I am happier than I know.--  While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,  From where I first drew air, and first beheld  This happy light; when, answer none returned,  On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,  Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep  First found me, and with soft oppression seised  My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought  I then was passing to my former state  Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:  When suddenly stood at my head a dream,  Whose inward apparition gently moved  My fancy to believe I yet had being,  And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine,  And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,  'First Man, of men innumerable ordained  'First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide  'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.'  So saying, by the hand he took me raised,  And over fields and waters, as in air  Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up  A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,  A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees  Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw  Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree,  Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye  Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite  To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found  Before mine eyes all real, as the dream  Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun  My wandering, had not he, who was my guide  Up hither, from among the trees appeared,  Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe,  In adoration at his feet I fell  Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,'  Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest  'Above, or round about thee, or beneath.  'This Paradise I give thee, count it thine  'To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:  'Of every tree that in the garden grows  'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:  'But of the tree whose operation brings  'Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set  'The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,  'Amid the garden by the tree of life,  'Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,  'And shun the bitter consequence: for know,  'The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command  'Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,  'From that day mortal; and this happy state  'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world  'Of woe and sorrow.'  Sternly he pronounced  The rigid interdiction, which resounds  Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice  Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect  Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.  'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth  'To thee and to thy race I give; as lords  'Possess it, and all things that therein live,  'Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.  'In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold  'After their kinds; I bring them to receive  'From thee their names, and pay thee fealty  'With low subjection; understand the same  'Of fish within their watery residence,  'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change  'Their element, to draw the thinner air.'  As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold  Approaching two and two; these cowering low  With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.  I named them, as they passed, and understood  Their nature, with such knowledge God endued  My sudden apprehension:  But in these  I found not what methought I wanted still;  And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.  O, by what name, for thou above all these,  Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,  Surpassest far my naming; how may I  Adore thee, Author of this universe,  And all this good to man? for whose well being  So amply, and with hands so liberal,  Thou hast provided all things:  But with me  I see not who partakes.  In solitude  What happiness, who can enjoy alone,  Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?  Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,  As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.  What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth  With various living creatures, and the air  Replenished, and all these at thy command  To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not  Their language and their ways?  They also know,  And reason not contemptibly:  With these  Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.  So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed  So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored,  And humble deprecation, thus replied.  Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;  My Maker, be propitious while I speak.  Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,  And these inferiour far beneath me set?  Among unequals what society  Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?  Which must be mutual, in proportion due  Given and received; but, in disparity  The one intense, the other still remiss,  Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove  Tedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak  Such as I seek, fit to participate  All rational delight: wherein the brute  Cannot be human consort:  They rejoice  Each with their kind, lion with lioness;  So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:  Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl  So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;  Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.  Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.  A nice and subtle happiness, I see,  Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice  Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste  No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.  What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?  Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed  Of happiness, or not? who am alone  From all eternity; for none I know  Second to me or like, equal much less.  How have I then with whom to hold converse,  Save with the creatures which I made, and those  To me inferiour, infinite descents  Beneath what other creatures are to thee?  He ceased; I lowly answered.  To attain  The highth and depth of thy eternal ways  All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!  Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee  Is no deficience found:  Not so is Man,  But in degree; the cause of his desire  By conversation with his like to help  Or solace his defects.  No need that thou  Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;  And through all numbers absolute, though One:  But Man by number is to manifest  His single imperfection, and beget  Like of his like, his image multiplied,  In unity defective; which requires  Collateral love, and dearest amity.  Thou in thy secresy although alone,  Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not  Social communication; yet, so pleased,  Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt  Of union or communion, deified:  I, by conversing, cannot these erect  From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.  Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used  Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained  This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.  Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;  And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,  Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;  Expressing well the spirit within thee free,  My image, not imparted to the brute;  Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee  Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;  And be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest,  Knew it not good for Man to be alone;  And no such company as then thou sawest  Intended thee; for trial only brought,  To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:  What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,  Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,  Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.  He ended, or I heard no more; for now  My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,  Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth  In that celestial colloquy sublime,  As with an object that excels the sense  Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair  Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called  By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.  Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell  Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,  Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,  Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape  Still glorious before whom awake I stood:  Who stooping opened my left side, and took  From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,  And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,  But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:  The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;  Under his forming hands a creature grew,  Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,  That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now  Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained  And in her looks; which from that time infused  Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,  And into all things from her air inspired  The spirit of love and amorous delight.  She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked  To find her, or for ever to deplore  Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:  When out of hope, behold her, not far off,  Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned  With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow  To make her amiable:  On she came,  Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,  And guided by his voice; nor uninformed  Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:  Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,  In every gesture dignity and love.  I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.  This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled  Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,  Giver of all things fair! but fairest this  Of all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see  Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself  Before me:  Woman is her name;of Man  Extracted: for this cause he shall forego  Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;  And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.  She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,  Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,  Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,  That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,  Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,  The more desirable; or, to say all,  Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,  Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:  I followed her; she what was honour knew,  And with obsequious majesty approved  My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower  I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,  And happy constellations, on that hour  Shed their selectest influence; the Earth  Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;  Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs  Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings  Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,  Disporting, till the amorous bird of night  Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star  On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.  Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought  My story to the sum of earthly bliss,  Which I enjoy; and must confess to find  In all things else delight indeed, but such  As, used or not, works in the mind no change,  Nor vehement desire; these delicacies  I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,  Walks, and the melody of birds: but here  Far otherwise, transported I behold,  Transported touch; here passion first I felt,  Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else  Superiour and unmoved; here only weak  Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance.  Or Nature failed in me, and left some part  Not proof enough such object to sustain;  Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps  More than enough; at least on her bestowed  Too much of ornament, in outward show  Elaborate, of inward less exact.  For well I understand in the prime end  Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind  And inward faculties, which most excel;  In outward also her resembling less  His image who made both, and less expressing  The character of that dominion given  O'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach  Her loveliness, so absolute she seems  And in herself complete, so well to know  Her own, that what she wills to do or say,  Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:  All higher knowledge in her presence falls  Degraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her  Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;  Authority and Reason on her wait,  As one intended first, not after made  Occasionally; and, to consummate all,  Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat  Build in her loveliest, and create an awe  About her, as a guard angelick placed.  To whom the Angel with contracted brow.  Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;  Do thou but thine; and be not diffident  Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou  Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,  By attributing overmuch to things  Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.  For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,  An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well  Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;  Not thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself;  Then value:  Oft-times nothing profits more  Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right  Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,  The more she will acknowledge thee her head,  And to realities yield all her shows:  Made so adorn for thy delight the more,  So awful, that with honour thou mayest love  Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.  But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind  Is propagated, seem such dear delight  Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed  To cattle and each beast; which would not be  To them made common and divulged, if aught  Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue  The soul of man, or passion in him move.  What higher in her society thou findest  Attractive, human, rational, love still;  In loving thou dost well, in passion not,  Wherein true love consists not:  Love refines  The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat  In reason, and is judicious; is the scale  By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,  Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,  Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.  To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.  Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught  In procreation common to all kinds,  (Though higher of the genial bed by far,  And with mysterious reverence I deem,)  So much delights me, as those graceful acts,  Those thousand decencies, that daily flow  From all her words and actions mixed with love  And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned  Union of mind, or in us both one soul;  Harmony to behold in wedded pair  More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.  Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose  What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,  Who meet with various objects, from the sense  Variously representing; yet, still free,  Approve the best, and follow what I approve.  To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,  Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;  Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:  Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love  Express they? by looks only? or do they mix  Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?  To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed  Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,  Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest  Us happy, and without love no happiness.  Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,  (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy  In eminence; and obstacle find none  Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;  Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,  Total they mix, union of pure with pure  Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,  As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.  But I can now no more; the parting sun  Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles  Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.  Be strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all,  Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep  His great command; take heed lest passion sway  Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will  Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,  The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!  I in thy persevering shall rejoice,  And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall  Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.  Perfect within, no outward aid require;  And all temptation to transgress repel.  So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus  Followed with benediction.  Since to part,  Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,  Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!  Gentle to me and affable hath been  Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever  With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind  Be good and friendly still, and oft return!  So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven  From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower. \r\n                         \n", "Paradise Lost: Book 09": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        No more of talk where God or Angel guest  With Man, as with his friend, familiar us'd,  To sit indulgent, and with him partake  Rural repast; permitting him the while  Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change  Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach  Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,  And disobedience: on the part of Heaven  Now alienated, distance and distaste,  Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,  That brought into this world a world of woe,  Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery  Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument  Not less but more heroick than the wrath  Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued  Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage  Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd;  Or Neptune's ire, or Juno's, that so long  Perplexed the Greek, and Cytherea's son:                            If answerable style I can obtain  Of my celestial patroness, who deigns  Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,  And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires  Easy my unpremeditated verse:  Since first this subject for heroick song  Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;  Not sedulous by nature to indite  Wars, hitherto the only argument  Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect  With long and tedious havock fabled knights  In battles feign'd; the better fortitude  Of patience and heroick martyrdom  Unsung; or to describe races and games,  Or tilting furniture, imblazon'd shields,  Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,  Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights  At joust and tournament; then marshall'd feast  Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals;  The skill of artifice or office mean,  Not that which justly gives heroick name  To person, or to poem.  Me, of these  Nor skill'd nor studious, higher argument  Remains; sufficient of itself to raise  That name, unless an age too late, or cold  Climate, or years, damp my intended wing  Depress'd; and much they may, if all be mine,  Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.  The sun was sunk, and after him the star  Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring  Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter  \"twixt day and night, and now from end to end  Night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round:  When satan, who late fled before the threats  Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd  In meditated fraud and malice, bent  On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap  Of heavier on himself, fearless returned  From compassing the earth; cautious of day,  Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried  His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim  That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,  The space of seven continued nights he rode  With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line  He circled; four times crossed the car of night  From pole to pole, traversing each colure;  On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse  From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth  Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,  Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change,  Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,  Into a gulf shot under ground, till part  Rose up a fountain by the tree of life:  In with the river sunk, and with it rose  Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought  Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land,  From Eden over Pontus and the pool  Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;  Downward as far antarctick; and in length,  West from Orontes to the ocean barred  At Darien ; thence to the land where flows  Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed  With narrow search; and with inspection deep  Considered every creature, which of all  Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found  The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.  Him after long debate, irresolute  Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose  Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide  From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake  Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,  As from his wit and native subtlety  Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed,  Doubt might beget of diabolick power  Active within, beyond the sense of brute.  Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief  His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.  More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!  O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred  For what God, after better, worse would build?  Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens  That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,  Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,  In thee concentring all their precious beams  Of sacred influence!  As God in Heaven  Is center, yet extends to all; so thou,  Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee,  Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears  Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth  Of creatures animate with gradual life  Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.  With what delight could I have walked thee round,  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange  Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,  Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,  Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these  Find place or refuge; and the more I see  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege  Of contraries: all good to me becomes  Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven  To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme;  Nor hope to be myself less miserable  By what I seek, but others to make such  As I, though thereby worse to me redound:  For only in destroying I find ease  To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,  Or won to what may work his utter loss,  For whom all this was made, all this will soon  Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe;  In woe then; that destruction wide may range:  To me shall be the glory sole among  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred  What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days  Continued making; and who knows how long  Before had been contriving? though perhaps  Not longer than since I, in one night, freed  From servitude inglorious well nigh half  The angelick name, and thinner left the throng  Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,  And to repair his numbers thus impaired,  Whether such virtue spent of old now failed  More Angels to create, if they at least  Are his created, or, to spite us more,  Determined to advance into our room  A creature formed of earth, and him endow,  Exalted from so base original,  With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,  He effected; Man he made, and for him built  Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,  Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!  Subjected to his service angel-wings,  And flaming ministers to watch and tend  Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance  I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist  Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry  In every bush and brake, where hap may find  The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.  O foul descent! that I, who erst contended  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained  Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,  That to the highth of Deity aspired!  But what will not ambition and revenge  Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low  As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,  Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,  Since higher I fall short, on him who next  Provokes my envy, this new favourite  Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,  Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised  From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.  So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,  Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on  His midnight-search, where soonest he might find  The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found  In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,  His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:  Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,  Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,  Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth  The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,  In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired  With act intelligential; but his sleep  Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.  Now, when as sacred light began to dawn  In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed  Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,  From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise  To the Creator, and his nostrils fill  With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,  And joined their vocal worship to the quire  Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake  The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:  Then commune, how that day they best may ply  Their growing work: for much their work out-grew  The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide,  And Eve first to her husband thus began.  Adam, well may we labour still to dress  This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,  Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,  One night or two with wanton growth derides  Tending to wild.  Thou therefore now advise,  Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present:  Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind  The woodbine round this arbour, or direct  The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,  In yonder spring of roses intermixed  With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:  For, while so near each other thus all day  Our task we choose, what wonder if so near  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new  Casual discourse draw on; which intermits  Our day's work, brought to little, though begun  Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?  To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.  Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond  Compare above all living creatures dear!  Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,  How we might best fulfil the work which here  God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass  Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found  In woman, than to study houshold good,  And good works in her husband to promote.  Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed  Labour, as to debar us when we need  Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,  Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse  Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,  To brute denied, and are of love the food;  Love, not the lowest end of human life.  For not to irksome toil, but to delight,  He made us, and delight to reason joined.  These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands  Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide  As we need walk, till younger hands ere long  Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps  Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:  For solitude sometimes is best society,  And short retirement urges sweet return.  But other doubt possesses me, lest harm  Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest  What hath been warned us, what malicious foe  Envying our happiness, and of his own  Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame  By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand  Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find  His wish and best advantage, us asunder;  Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each  To other speedy aid might lend at need:  Whether his first design be to withdraw  Our fealty from God, or to disturb  Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss  Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;  Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side  That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.  The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,  Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,  Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.  To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,  As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,  With sweet austere composure thus replied.  Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord!  That such an enemy we have, who seeks  Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,  And from the parting Angel over-heard,  As in a shady nook I stood behind,  Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.  But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt  To God or thee, because we have a foe  May tempt it, I expected not to hear.  His violence thou fearest not, being such  As we, not capable of death or pain,  Can either not receive, or can repel.  His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers  Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love  Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;  Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,  Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?  To whom with healing words Adam replied.  Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!  For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:  Not diffident of thee do I dissuade  Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid  The attempt itself, intended by our foe.  For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses  The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed  Not incorruptible of faith, not proof  Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn  And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,  Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,  If such affront I labour to avert  From thee alone, which on us both at once  The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;  Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.  Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;  Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce  Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid.  I, from the influence of thy looks, receive  Access in every virtue; in thy sight  More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were  Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,  Shame to be overcome or over-reached,  Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.  Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel  When I am present, and thy trial choose  With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?  So spake domestick Adam in his care  And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought  Less attributed to her faith sincere,  Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.  If this be our condition, thus to dwell  In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,  Subtle or violent, we not endued  Single with like defence, wherever met;  How are we happy, still in fear of harm?  But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,  Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem  Of our integrity: his foul esteem  Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns  Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared  By us? who rather double honour gain  From his surmise proved false; find peace within,  Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.  And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed  Alone, without exteriour help sustained?  Let us not then suspect our happy state  Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,  As not secure to single or combined.  Frail is our happiness, if this be so,  And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.  To whom thus Adam fervently replied.  O Woman, best are all things as the will  Of God ordained them: His creating hand  Nothing imperfect or deficient left  Of all that he created, much less Man,  Or aught that might his happy state secure,  Secure from outward force; within himself  The danger lies, yet lies within his power:  Against his will he can receive no harm.  But God left free the will; for what obeys  Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,  But bid her well be ware, and still erect;  Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,  She dictate false; and mis-inform the will  To do what God expressly hath forbid.  Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,  That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.  Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;  Since Reason not impossibly may meet  Some specious object by the foe suborned,  And fall into deception unaware,  Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.  Seek not temptation then, which to avoid  Were better, and most likely if from me  Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.  Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve  First thy obedience; the other who can know,  Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?  But, if thou think, trial unsought may find  Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,  Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;  Go in thy native innocence, rely  On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!  For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.  So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve  Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.  With thy permission then, and thus forewarned  Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words  Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,  May find us both perhaps far less prepared,  The willinger I go, nor much expect  A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;  So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.  Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand  Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,  Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train,  Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self  In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,  Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,  But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,  Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.  To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,  Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled  Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,  Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.  Her long with ardent look his eye pursued  Delighted, but desiring more her stay.  Oft he to her his charge of quick return  Repeated; she to him as oft engaged  To be returned by noon amid the bower,  And all things in best order to invite  Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose.  O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,  Of thy presumed return! event perverse!  Thou never from that hour in Paradise  Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;  Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,  Waited with hellish rancour imminent  To intercept thy way, or send thee back  Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!  For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,  Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;  And on his quest, where likeliest he might find  The only two of mankind, but in them  The whole included race, his purposed prey.  In bower and field he sought, where any tuft  Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,  Their tendance, or plantation for delight;  By fountain or by shady rivulet  He sought them both, but wished his hap might find  Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope  Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,  Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,  Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,  Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round  About her glowed, oft stooping to support  Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay  Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,  Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays  Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while  Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,  From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.  Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed  Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;  Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,  Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers  Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:  Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned  Or of revived Adonis, or renowned  Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son;  Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king  Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.  Much he the place admired, the person more.  As one who long in populous city pent,  Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,  Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe  Among the pleasant villages and farms  Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;  The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,  Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;  If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,  What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;  She most, and in her look sums all delight:  Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold  This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve  Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form  Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,  Her graceful innocence, her every air  Of gesture, or least action, overawed  His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved  His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:  That space the Evil-one abstracted stood  From his own evil, and for the time remained  Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,  Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:  But the hot Hell that always in him burns,  Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,  And tortures him now more, the more he sees  Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon  Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts  Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.  Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet  Compulsion thus transported, to forget  What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope  Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste  Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,  Save what is in destroying; other joy  To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass  Occasion which now smiles; behold alone  The woman, opportune to all attempts,  Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,  Whose higher intellectual more I shun,  And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb  Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;  Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,  I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain  Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.  She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!  Not terrible, though terrour be in love  And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,  Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;  The way which to her ruin now I tend.  So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed  In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve  Addressed his way: not with indented wave,  Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,  Circular base of rising folds, that towered  Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head  Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;  With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect  Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass  Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape  And lovely; never since of serpent-kind  Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,  Hermione and Cadmus, or the god  In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed  Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;  He with Olympias; this with her who bore  Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique  At first, as one who sought access, but feared  To interrupt, side-long he works his way.  As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought  Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind  Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:  So varied he, and of his tortuous train  Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,  To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound  Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used  To such disport before her through the field,  From every beast; more duteous at her call,  Than at Circean call the herd disguised.  He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,  But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed  His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,  Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.  His gentle dumb expression turned at length  The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad  Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue  Organick, or impulse of vocal air,  His fraudulent temptation thus began.  Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps  Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm  Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,  Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze  Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared  Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.  Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,  Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine  By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore  With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,  Where universally admired; but here  In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,  Beholders rude, and shallow to discern  Half what in thee is fair, one man except,  Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen  A Goddess among Gods, adored and served  By Angels numberless, thy daily train.  So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:  Into the heart of Eve his words made way,  Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,  Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.  What may this mean? language of man pronounced  By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?  The first, at least, of these I thought denied  To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,  Created mute to all articulate sound:  The latter I demur; for in their looks  Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.  Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field  I knew, but not with human voice endued;  Redouble then this miracle, and say,  How camest thou speakable of mute, and how  To me so friendly grown above the rest  Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?  Say, for such wonder claims attention due.  To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.  Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!  Easy to me it is to tell thee all  What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:  I was at first as other beasts that graze  The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,  As was my food; nor aught but food discerned  Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:  Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced  A goodly tree far distant to behold  Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,  Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;  When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,  Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense  Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats  Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,  Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.  To satisfy the sharp desire I had  Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved  Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,  Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent  Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.  About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;  For, high from ground, the branches would require  Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree  All other beasts that saw, with like desire  Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.  Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung  Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill  I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,  At feed or fountain, never had I found.  Sated at length, ere long I might perceive  Strange alteration in me, to degree  Of reason in my inward powers; and speech  Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.  Thenceforth to speculations high or deep  I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind  Considered all things visible in Heaven,  Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:  But all that fair and good in thy divine  Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray,  United I beheld; no fair to thine  Equivalent or second! which compelled  Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come  And gaze, and worship thee of right declared  Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!  So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,  Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.  Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt  The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:  But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?  For many are the trees of God that grow  In Paradise, and various, yet unknown  To us; in such abundance lies our choice,  As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,  Still hanging incorruptible, till men  Grow up to their provision, and more hands  Help to disburden Nature of her birth.  To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.  Empress, the way is ready, and not long;  Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,  Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past  Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept  My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon  Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled  In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,  To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy  Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,  Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night  Condenses, and the cold environs round,  Kindled through agitation to a flame,  Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,  Hovering and blazing with delusive light,  Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way  To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;  There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.  So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud  Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree  Of prohibition, root of all our woe;  Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.  Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,  Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,  The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;  Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.  But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;  God so commanded, and left that command  Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live  Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.  To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.  Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit  Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,  Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air$?  To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.  Of the fruit  Of each tree in the garden we may eat;  But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst  The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat  Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold  The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love  To Man, and indignation at his wrong,  New part puts on; and, as to passion moved,  Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act  Raised, as of some great matter to begin.  As when of old some orator renowned,  In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence  Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,  Stood in himself collected; while each part,  Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;  Sometimes in highth began, as no delay  Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:  So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,  The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.  O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,  Mother of science! now I feel thy power  Within me clear; not only to discern  Things in their causes, but to trace the ways  Of highest agents, deemed however wise.  Queen of this universe! do not believe  Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:  How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life  To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,  Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,  And life more perfect have attained than Fate  Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.  Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast  Is open? or will God incense his ire  For such a petty trespass? and not praise  Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain  Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,  Deterred not from achieving what might lead  To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;  Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil  Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?  God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;  Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:  Your fear itself of death removes the fear.  Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe;  Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,  His worshippers?  He knows that in the day  Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,  Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then  Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,  Knowing both good and evil, as they know.  That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,  Internal Man, is but proportion meet;  I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.  So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off  Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,  Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.  And what are Gods, that Man may not become  As they, participating God-like food?  The Gods are first, and that advantage use  On our belief, that all from them proceeds:  I question it; for this fair earth I see,  Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;  Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed  Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,  That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains  Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies  The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?  What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree  Impart against his will, if all be his?  Or is it envy? and can envy dwell  In heavenly breasts?  These, these, and many more  Causes import your need of this fair fruit.  Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!  He ended; and his words, replete with guile,  Into her heart too easy entrance won:  Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold  Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound  Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned  With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:  Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked  An eager appetite, raised by the smell  So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,  Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,  Solicited her longing eye; yet first  Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.  Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,  Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;  Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay  Gave elocution to the mute, and taught  The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:  Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,  Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree  Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;  Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding  Commends thee more, while it infers the good  By thee communicated, and our want:  For good unknown sure is not had; or, had  And yet unknown, is as not had at all.  In plain then, what forbids he but to know,  Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?  Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death  Bind us with after-bands, what profits then  Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat  Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!  How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,  And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,  Irrational till then.  For us alone  Was death invented? or to us denied  This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?  For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first  Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy  The good befallen him, author unsuspect,  Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.  What fear I then? rather, what know to fear  Under this ignorance of good and evil,  Of God or death, of law or penalty?  Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,  Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,  Of virtue to make wise:  What hinders then  To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?  So saying, her rash hand in evil hour  Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!  Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,  Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,  That all was lost.  Back to the thicket slunk  The guilty Serpent; and well might;for Eve,  Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else  Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,  In fruit she never tasted, whether true  Or fancied so, through expectation high  Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.  Greedily she ingorged without restraint,  And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length,  And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,  Thus to herself she pleasingly began.  O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees  In Paradise! of operation blest  To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.  And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end  Created; but henceforth my early care,  Not without song, each morning, and due praise,  Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease  Of thy full branches offered free to all;  Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature  In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;  Though others envy what they cannot give:  For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here  Thus grown.  Experience, next, to thee I owe,  Best guide; not following thee, I had remained  In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way,  And givest access, though secret she retire.  And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,  High, and remote to see from thence distinct  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps  May have diverted from continual watch  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies  About him.  But to Adam in what sort  Shall I appear? shall I to him make known  As yet my change, and give him to partake  Full happiness with me, or rather not,  But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power  Without copartner? so to add what wants  In female sex, the more to draw his love,  And render me more equal; and perhaps,  A thing not undesirable, sometime  Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free  This may be well:  But what if God have seen,  And death ensue? then I shall be no more!  And Adam, wedded to another Eve,  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;  A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve,  Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths  I could endure, without him live no life.  So saying, from the tree her step she turned;  But first low reverence done, as to the Power  That dwelt within, whose presence had infused  Into the plant sciential sap, derived  From nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while,  Waiting desirous her return, had wove  Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn  Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;  As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.  Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new  Solace in her return, so long delayed:  Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,  Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;  And forth to meet her went, the way she took  That morn when first they parted: by the tree  Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,  Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand  A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,  New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.  To him she hasted; in her face excuse  Came prologue, and apology too prompt;  Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.  Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?  Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived  Thy presence; agony of love till now  Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more  Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,  The pain of absence from thy sight.  But strange  Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:  This tree is not, as we are told, a tree  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown  Opening the way, but of divine effect  To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;  And hath been tasted such:  The serpent wise,  Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,  Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,  Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth  Endued with human voice and human sense,  Reasoning to admiration; and with me  Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I  Have also tasted, and have also found  The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,  Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;  Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.  Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot  May join us, equal joy, as equal love;  Lest, thou not tasting, different degree  Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce  Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.  Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;  But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.  On the other side Adam, soon as he heard  The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,  Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill  Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;  From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve  Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length  First to himself he inward silence broke.  O fairest of Creation, last and best  Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled  Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,  Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!  How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,  Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!  Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress  The strict forbiddance, how to violate  The sacred fruit forbidden!  Some cursed fraud  Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,  And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee  Certain my resolution is to die:  How can I live without thee! how forego  Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,  To live again in these wild woods forlorn!  Should God create another Eve, and I  Another rib afford, yet loss of thee  Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel  The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,  Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state  Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.  So having said, as one from sad dismay  Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed  Submitting to what seemed remediless,  Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.  Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,  And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,  Had it been only coveting to eye  That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,  Much more to taste it under ban to touch.  But past who can recall, or done undo?  Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so  Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact  Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,  Profaned first by the serpent, by him first  Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;  Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;  Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,  Higher degree of life; inducement strong  To us, as likely tasting to attain  Proportional ascent; which cannot be  But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.  Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,  Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy  Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,  Set over all his works; which in our fall,  For us created, needs with us must fail,  Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,  Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;  Not well conceived of God, who, though his power  Creation could repeat, yet would be loth  Us to abolish, lest the Adversary  Triumph, and say; \"Fickle their state whom God  \"Most favours; who can please him long? Me first  \"He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?\"  Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.  However I with thee have fixed my lot,  Certain to undergo like doom:  If death  Consort with thee, death is to me as life;  So forcible within my heart I feel  The bond of Nature draw me to my own;  My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;  Our state cannot be severed; we are one,  One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.  So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.  O glorious trial of exceeding love,  Illustrious evidence, example high!  Engaging me to emulate; but, short  Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,  Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,  And gladly of our union hear thee speak,  One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof  This day affords, declaring thee resolved,  Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,  Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,  To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,  If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;  Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,  Direct, or by occasion, hath presented  This happy trial of thy love, which else  So eminently never had been known?  Were it I thought death menaced would ensue  This my attempt, I would sustain alone  The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die  Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact  Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured  Remarkably so late of thy so true,  So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel  Far otherwise the event; not death, but life  Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,  Taste so divine, that what of sweet before  Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.  On my experience, Adam, freely taste,  And fear of death deliver to the winds.  So saying, she embraced him, and for joy  Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love  Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur  Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.  In recompence for such compliance bad  Such recompence best merits from the bough  She gave him of that fair enticing fruit  With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,  Against his better knowledge; not deceived,  But fondly overcome with female charm.  Earth trembled from her entrails, as again  In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;  Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops  Wept at completing of the mortal sin  Original: while Adam took no thought,  Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate  Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth  Him with her loved society; that now,  As with new wine intoxicated both,  They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel  Divinity within them breeding wings,  Wherewith to scorn the earth:  But that false fruit  Far other operation first displayed,  Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve  Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him  As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:  Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move.  Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,  And elegant, of sapience no small part;  Since to each meaning savour we apply,  And palate call judicious; I the praise  Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.  Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained  From this delightful fruit, nor known till now  True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be  In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,  For this one tree had been forbidden ten.  But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,  As meet is, after such delicious fare;  For never did thy beauty, since the day  I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned  With all perfections, so inflame my sense  With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now  Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!  So said he, and forbore not glance or toy  Of amorous intent; well understood  Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.  Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,  Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,  He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,  Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,  And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap.  There they their fill of love and love's disport  Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,  The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep  Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,  Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,  That with exhilarating vapour bland  About their spirits had played, and inmost powers  Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,  Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams  Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose  As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,  Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds  How darkened; innocence, that as a veil  Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;  Just confidence, and native righteousness,  And honour, from about them, naked left  To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe  Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong,  Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap  Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked  Shorn of his strength.  They destitute and bare  Of all their virtue:  Silent, and in face  Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:  Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,  At length gave utterance to these words constrained.  O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear  To that false worm, of whomsoever taught  To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall,  False in our promised rising; since our eyes  Opened we find indeed, and find we know  Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;  Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;  Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,  Of innocence, of faith, of purity,  Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,  And in our faces evident the signs  Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;  Even shame, the last of evils; of the first  Be sure then.--How shall I behold the face  Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy  And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes  Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze  Insufferably bright.  O! might I here  In solitude live savage; in some glade  Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable  To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad  And brown as evening:  Cover me, ye Pines!  Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs  Hide me, where I may never see them more!--  But let us now, as in bad plight, devise  What best may for the present serve to hide  The parts of each from other, that seem most  To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;  Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,  And girded on our loins, may cover round  Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,  There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.  So counselled he, and both together went  Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose  The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,  But such as at this day, to Indians known,  In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms  Branching so broad and long, that in the ground  The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow  About the mother tree, a pillared shade  High over-arched, and echoing walks between:  There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,  Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds  At loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves  They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;  And, with what skill they had, together sewed,  To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide  Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike  To that first naked glory!  Such of late  Columbus found the American, so girt  With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild  Among the trees on isles and woody shores.  Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part  Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,  They sat them down to weep; nor only tears  Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within  Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,  Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore  Their inward state of mind, calm region once  And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:  For Understanding ruled not, and the Will  Heard not her lore; both in subjection now  To sensual Appetite, who from beneath  Usurping over sovran Reason claimed  Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,  Adam, estranged in look and altered style,  Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.  Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid  With me, as I besought thee, when that strange  Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,  I know not whence possessed thee; we had then  Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled  Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!  Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve  The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek  Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.  To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.  What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!  Imputest thou that to my default, or will  Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows  But might as ill have happened thou being by,  Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there,  Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned  Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;  No ground of enmity between us known,  Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.  Was I to have never parted from thy side?  As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.  Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,  Command me absolutely not to go,  Going into such danger, as thou saidst?  Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;  Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.  Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,  Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.  To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.  Is this the love, is this the recompence  Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed  Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;  Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,  Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?  And am I now upbraided as the cause  Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe,  It seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more  I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold  The danger, and the lurking enemy  That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;  And force upon free will hath here no place.  But confidence then bore thee on; secure  Either to meet no danger, or to find  Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps  I also erred, in overmuch admiring  What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought  No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue  The errour now, which is become my crime,  And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall  Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,  Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;  And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,  She first his weak indulgence will accuse.  Thus they in mutual accusation spent  The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;  And of their vain contest appeared no end. \r\n                         \n", "Paradise Lost: Book X": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port Not of mean suiters, nor important less Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair In Fables old, less ancient yet then these, Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd, By thir great Intercessor, came in sight Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son Presenting, thus to intercede began. See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring, Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those Which his own hand manuring all the Trees Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee Interpret for him, mee his Advocate And propitiation, all his works on mee Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay. Accept me, and in mee from these receave The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, Made one with me as I with thee am one. To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene. All thy request for Man, accepted Son, Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: But longer in that Paradise to dwell, The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: Those pure immortal Elements that know No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, Eject him tainted now, and purge him off As a distemper, gross to aire as gross, And mortal food, as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts Created him endowd, with Happiness And Immortalitie: that fondly lost, This other serv'd but to eternize woe; Till I provided Death; so Death becomes His final remedie, and after Life Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, Wak't in the renovation of the just, Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd. But let us call to Synod all the Blest Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, As how with peccant Angels late they saw; And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. He ended, and the Son gave signal high To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended, and perhaps once more To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring, By the waters of Life, where ere they sate In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will. O Sons, like one of us Man is become To know both Good and Evil, since his taste Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known Good by it self, and Evil not at all. He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, My motions in him, longer then they move, His heart I know, how variable and vain Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, And live for ever, dream at least to live Forever, to remove him I decree, And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. Michael, this my behest have thou in charge, Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend Or in behalf of Man, or to invade Vacant possession som new trouble raise: Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce To them and to thir Progenie from thence Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, For I behold them soft'nd and with tears Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. If patiently thy bidding they obey, Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale To Adam what shall come in future dayes, As I shall thee enlighten, intermix My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd; So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: And on the East side of the Garden place, Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: Least Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile To resalute the World with sacred Light Leucothia wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve Had ended now thir Orisons, and found, Strength added from above, new hope to spring Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n So prevalent as to concerne the mind Of God high blest, or to incline his will, Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease, Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, Methought I saw him placable and mild, Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew That I was heard with favour; peace returnd Home to my brest, and to my memorie His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; Which then not minded in dismay, yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for Man. To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: But infinite in pardon was my Judge, That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't The sourse of life; next favourable thou, Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, Farr other name deserving. But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, I never from thy side henceforth to stray, Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie, because from death releast Some days; how long, and what till then our life, Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, And thither must return and be no more. VVhy else this double object in our sight Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground One way the self-same hour? why in the East Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, A glorious Apparition, had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. Not that more glorious, when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, Against the Syrian King, who to surprize One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise Possession of the Garden; hee alone, To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps Of us will soon determin, or impose New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate None of the meanest, some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie Invests him coming; yet not terrible, That I should fear, nor sociably mild, As Raphael, that I should much confide, But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes A militarie Vest of purple flowd Livelier then Meliboean or the graine Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State  Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, Defeated of his seisure many dayes Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not; to remove thee I am come, And send thee from the Garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. He added not, for Adam at the newes Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen Yet all had heard, with audible lament Discover'd soon the place of her retire. O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, Quiet though sad, the respit of that day That must be mortal to us both. O flours, That never will in other Climate grow, My early visitation, and my last At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; Where he abides, think there thy native soile. Adam by this from the cold sudden damp Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, To Michael thus his humble words addressd. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould Thy message, which might else in telling wound, And in performing end us; what besides Of sorrow and dejection and despair Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, Departure from this happy place, our sweet Recess, and onely consolation left Familiar to our eyes, all places else Inhospitable appeer and desolate, Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of him who all things can, I would not cease To wearie him with my assiduous cries: But prayer against his absolute Decree No more availes then breath against the winde, Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: Therefore to his great bidding I submit. This most afflicts me, that departing hence, As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree Stood visible, among these Pines his voice I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, Or monument to Ages, and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours: In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances, or footstep trace? For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, No despicable gift; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd Of Paradise or Eden: this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred All generations, and had hither come From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. But this pr\u00e6eminence thou hast lost, brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine God is as here, and will be found alike Present, and of his presence many a signe Still following thee, still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love, his Face Express, and of his steps the track Divine. Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn True patience, and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow, equally enur'd By moderation either state to beare, Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, However chast'ning, to the evil turne My obvious breast, arming to overcom By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, If so I may attain. So both ascend In the Visions of God: It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest, from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second Adam in the Wilderness, To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame, the Seat Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, To Paquin of Sin\u00e6an Kings, and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul Down to the golden Chersonese, or where The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd. So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; The others not, for his was not sincere; Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, For envie that his Brothers Offering found From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! But have I now seen Death? Is this the way I must return to native dust? O sight Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen In his first shape on man; but many shapes Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense More terrible at th' entrance then within. Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men. Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd His best of Man, and gave him up to tears A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. O miserable Mankind, to what fall Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n To be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew What we receive, would either not accept Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus Th' Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect, though faultie since, To such unsightly sufferings be debas't Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, Retaining still Divine similitude In part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt? Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. Therefore so abject is thir punishment, Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. But is there yet no other way, besides These painful passages, how we may come To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? There is, said Michael, if thou well observe The rule of not too much, by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, Till many years over thy head return: So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: This is old age; but then thou must outlive Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change To witherd weak &amp; gray; thy Senses then Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne A melancholly damp of cold and dry To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong Life much, bent rather how I may be quit Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendring up. Michael to him repli'd. Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: And now prepare thee for another sight. He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch Instinct through all proportions low and high Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent To worship God aright, and know his works Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. Such happy interview and fair event Of love &amp; youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, Much better seems this Vision, and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, Created, as thou art, to nobler end Holie and pure, conformitie divine. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother; studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise; Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. O pittie and shame, that they who to live well Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. But now prepare thee for another Scene. He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred Before him, Towns, and rural works between, Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, Single or in Array of Battel rang'd Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field Deserted: Others to a Citie strong Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, Assaulting; others from the Wall defend With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. In other part the scepter'd Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates: anon Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon In factious opposition, till at last Of middle Age one rising, eminent In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, And Judgement from above: him old and young Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence Unseen amid the throng: so violence Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men, and multiply Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew His Brother; for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? To whom thus Michael: These are the product Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. Such were these Giants, men of high renown; For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; To overcome in Battel, and subdue Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, And what most merits fame in silence hid. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse, And therefore hated, therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just, And utter odious Truth, that God would come To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. He look'd, &amp; saw the face of things quite chang'd; The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, Marrying or prostituting, as befell, Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend Sire among them came, And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls In prison under Judgements imminent: But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, Measur'd by Cubit, length, &amp; breadth, and highth, Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, &amp; with black wings Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, Depopulation; thee another Floud, Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. O Visions ill foreseen! better had I Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne My part of evil onely, each dayes lot Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst The burd'n of many Ages, on me light At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, With thought that they must be. Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd With length of happy days the race of man; But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, And whether here the Race of man will end. To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits, but of true vertu void; Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; One Man except, the onely Son of light In a dark Age, against example good, Against allurement, custom, and a World Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish, and before them set The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence; and shall returne Of them derided, but of God observd The one just Man alive; by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, To save himself and houshold from amidst A World devote to universal rack. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie, if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. And now what further shall ensue, behold. He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, And after him, the surer messenger, A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; The second time returning, in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. O thou that future things canst represent As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just, That God voutsafes to raise another World From him, and all his anger to forget. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; So willingly doth God remit his Ire, Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, That he relents, not to blot out mankind, And makes a Covenant never to destroy The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: Henceforth what is to com I will relate, Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few, And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart, who not content With fair equalitie, fraternal state, Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd Over his brethren, and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n, Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie; And from Rebellion shall derive his name, Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie &amp; Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n; And get themselves a name, least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost, Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language, and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders; each to other calls Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n And looking down, to see the hubbub strange And hear the din; thus was the building left Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd. Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd. O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren, to himself affirming Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n: He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl Dominion absolute; that right we hold By his donation; but Man over men He made not Lord; such title to himself Reserving, human left from human free. But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st That Son, who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue Rational Libertie; yet know withall, Since thy original lapse, true Libertie Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being: Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd, Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason, and to servitude reduce Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in Judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie, Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, Servant of servants, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World, Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw His presence from among them, and avert His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd, A Nation from one faithful man to spring: Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood, As to forsake the living God, and fall To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house, His kindred and false Gods, into a Land Which he will shew him, and from him will raise A mightie Nation, and upon him showre His benediction so, that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile Ur of Chald\u00e6a, passing now the Ford To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown. Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreb; there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; From Hamath Northward to the Desert South (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd) From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir; that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call'd Egypt, divided by the River Nile; See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation, and now grown Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: Till by two brethren (those two brethren call Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime His people from enthralment, they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies To know thir God, or message to regard, Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, Haile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian Skie And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls; What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds This River-dragon tam'd at length submits To let his sojourners depart, and oft Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls, Aw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar: Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, Though present in his Angel, who shall goe Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, By day a Cloud, by night a pillar of Fire, To guide them in thir journey, and remove Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues: All night he will pursue, but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found Thir government, and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top Shall tremble, he descending, will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine To civil Justice, part religious Rites Of sacrifice, informing them, by types And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech That Moses might report to them his will, And terror cease; he grants them thir desire, Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office now Moses in figure beares, to introduce One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites Establisht, such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle, The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, The Records of his Cov'nant, over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night, Save when they journie, and at length they come, Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand, And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon Till Israel overcome; so call the third From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. Here Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n, Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd, Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, Favour unmerited by me, who sought Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means. This yet I apprehend not, why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are giv'n; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them; how can God with such reside? To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them, as of thee begot; And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up Sin against Law to fight; that when they see Law can discover sin, but not remove, Save by those shadowie expiations weak, The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, Just for unjust, that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed, they may finde Justification towards God, and peace Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part Perform, and not performing cannot live. So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not Moses, though of God Highly belov'd, being but the Minister Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversarie Serpent, and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins National interrupt thir public peace, Provoking God to raise them enemies: From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom The second, both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure; the like shall sing All Prophecie, [t]hat of the Royal Stock Of David (so I name this King) shall rise A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue, And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd, The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. Such follow him, as shall be registerd Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd. There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years, then brings them back, Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n. Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God They first re-edifie, and for a while In mean estate live moderate, till grown In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; But first among the Priests dissension springs, Men who attend the Altar, and should most Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, Then loose it to a stranger, that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com, And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns. He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears, Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher Of utmost hope! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, Why our great expectation should be call'd The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High; So God with man unites. Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine: say where and when Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, As of a Duel, or the local wounds Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil Thy enemie; nor so is overcome Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise, Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound: Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, Not by destroying Satan, but his works In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd On penaltie of death, and suffering death, The penaltie to thy transgression due, And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: So onely can high Justice rest appaid. The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love, though love Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death, Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption, and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, His death for Man, as many as offerd Life Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of works: this God-like act Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, In sin for ever lost from life; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples, Men who in his Life Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn'd And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend With victory, triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines Through all his realme, &amp; there confounded leave; Then enter into glory, and resume His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come, When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead, To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward His faithful, and receave them into bliss, Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier place Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd, As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce, And evil turn to good; more wonderful Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, To God more glory, more good will to Men From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n Must reascend, what will betide the few His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, The enemies of truth; who then shall guide His people, who defend? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n Hee to his own a Comforter will send, The promise of the Father, who shall dwell His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, To guide them in all truth, and also arme With spiritual Armour, able to resist Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts What Man can do against them, not affraid, Though to the death, against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenc't, And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends To evangelize the Nations, then on all Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, Places and titles, and with these to joine Secular power, though feigning still to act By spiritual, to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume: Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning, till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid, The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve Satan with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love, To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd. How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time, Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, And love with feare the onely God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend, Merciful over all his works, with good Still overcoming evil, and by small Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie, And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd: This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers, All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea, And all the riches of this World enjoydst, And all the rule, one Empire; onely add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A Paradise within thee, happier farr. Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd To meek submission: thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her Seed to come (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd With meditation on the happie end. He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. Whence thou returnst, &amp; whither wentst, I know; For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, Which he hath sent propitious, some great good Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secure I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard VVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended; on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't, The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd. They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes: Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitarie way. \r\n                         \n", "Psalm 83": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Be not thou silent now at length O God hold not thy peace, Sit not thou still O God of strength We cry and do not cease.

This was a Statute giv'n of old For Israel to observe A Law of Jacobs God, to hold From whence they might not swerve. This he a Testimony ordain'd In Joseph, not to change, When as he pass'd through Aegypt land; The Tongue I heard, was strange.                                  From burden, and from slavish toyle I set his shoulder free; His hands from pots, and mirie soyle Deliver'd were by me.

I am the Lord thy God which brought Thee out of Aegypt land Ask large enough, and I, besought, Will grant thy full demand. And yet my people would not hear, Nor hearken to my voice; And Israel whom I lov'd so dear Mislik'd me for his choice. Then did I leave them to their will And to their wandring mind;                                       Their own conceits they follow'd still Their own devises blind O that my people would be wise To serve me all their daies, And O that Israel would advise To walk my righteous waies.

Only with speeches fair She woos the gentle air To hide her guilty front with innocent snow, And on her naked shame, Pollute with sinful blame, The saintly veil of maiden white to throw, Confounded that her Maker's eyes Should look so near upon her foul deformities.  But He, her fears to cease, Sent down the meek-eyed Peace; She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding Down through the turning sphere, His ready harbinger, With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing; And waving wide her myrtle wand, She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.  Nor war, or battle's sound Was heard the world around: The idle spear and shield were high uphung, The hooked chariot stood Unstained with hostile blood, The trumpet spake not to the armed throng; And kings sat still with awful eye, As if they surely knew their sov'reign Lord was by.  But peaceful was the night, Wherein the Prince of Light His reign of peace upon the earth began: The winds with wonder whist Smoothly the waters kist, Whisp'ring new joys to the mild ocean, Who now hath quite forgot to rave, While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.  The stars with deep amaze Stand fixed in steadfast gaze, Bending one way their precious influence, And will not take their flight, For all the morning light, Or Lucifer that often warned them thence; But in their glimmering orbs did glow, Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go.  And though the shady gloom Had given day her room, The sun himself withheld his wonted speed, And hid his head for shame, As his inferior flame The new-enlightened world no more should need; He saw a greater sun appear Than his bright throne, or burning axletree could bear.  The shepherds on the lawn, Or ere the point of dawn, Sat simply chatting in a rustic row; Full little thought they then That the mighty Pan Was kindly come to live with them below; Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep, Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.  When such music sweet Their hearts and ears did greet, As never was by mortal finger strook, Divinely-warbled voice Answering the stringed noise, As all their souls in blissful rapture took: The air such pleasure loth to lose, With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.  Nature that heard such sound, Beneath the hollow round Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling, Now was almost won To think her part was done, And that her reign had here its last fulfilling; She knew such harmony alone Could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union.  At last surrounds their sight A globe of circular light, That with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed; The helmed Cherubim, And sworded Seraphim, Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed, Harping in loud and solemn quire, With unexpressive notes to Heaven's new-born Heir.  Such music (as 'tis said) Before was never made, But when of old the sons of morning sung, While the Creator great His constellations set, And the well-balanced world on hinges hung, And cast the dark foundations deep, And bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep.  Ring out, ye crystal spheres, Once bless our human ears, If ye have power to touch our senses so; And let your silver chime Move in melodious time, And let the base of heav'n's deep organ blow; And with your ninefold harmony Make up full consort to th' angelic symphony.  For if such holy song Enwrap our fancy long, Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold, And speckled Vanity Will sicken soon and die, And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould; And Hell itself will pass away, And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.  Yea Truth and Justice then Will down return to men, Orbed in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing, Mercy will sit between, Throned in celestial sheen, With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering; And Heav'n, as at some festival, Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.  But wisest Fate says No, This must not yet be so, The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy That on the bitter cross Must redeem our loss; So both Himself and us to glorify; Yet first, to those ychained in sleep The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep;  With such a horrid clang As on mount Sinai rang, While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake: The aged Earth aghast, With terror of that blast, Shall from the surface to the centre shake; When at the world's last session, The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne.  And then at last our bliss Full and perfect is, But now begins; for from this happy day The old Dragon under ground, In straiter limits bound, Not half so far casts his usurped sway; And wroth to see his kingdom fail, Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.  The oracles are dumb, No voice or hideous hum Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving. Apollo from his shrine Can no more divine, With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving. No nightly trance or breathed spell Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.  The lonely mountains o'er, And the resounding shore, A voice of weeping heard and loud lament; From haunted spring, and dale Edged with popular pale, The parting genius is with sighing sent; With flow'r-inwoven tresses torn The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.  In consecrated earth, And on the holy hearth, The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint; In urns and altars round, A drear and dying sound Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint; And the chill marble seems to sweat, While each peculiar Pow'r forgoes his wonted seat.  Peor and Baalim Forsake their temples dim, With that twice-battered God of Palestine; And mooned Ashtaroth, Heav'n's queen and mother both, Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine; The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn, In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.  And sullen Moloch fled, Hath left in shadows dread His burning idol all of blackest hue; In vain with cymbals' ring They call the grisly king, In dismal dance about the furnace blue; The brutish gods of Nile as fast, Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis haste.  Nor is Osiris seen In Memphian grove or green, Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud: Nor can he be at rest Within his sacred chest, Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud; In vain with timbrelled anthems dark The sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark.  He feels from Juda's land The dreaded Infant's hand, The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn; Nor all the gods beside Longer dare abide, Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine: Our Babe, to show his Godhead true, Can in His swaddling bands control the damned crew.  So when the sun in bed, Curtained with cloudy red, Pillows his chin upon an orient wave, The flocking shadows pale Troop to th' infernal jail, Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave; And the yellow-skirted Fayes Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.  But see, the Virgin blest Hath laid her Babe to rest, Time is our tedious song should here have ending: Heav'n's youngest-teemed star  Hath fixed her polished car, Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending; And all about the courtly stable Bright-harnessed Angels sit in order serviceable. \r\n                         \n", "Psalm Cxxxvi": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Let us with a gladsome mind  Praise the Lord for he is kind;  For his mercies aye endure,  Ever faithful, ever sure.
