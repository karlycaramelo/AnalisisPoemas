A saintly sparrow jargons madrigals to waken dreamers in the milky dawn, while tulips bow like a college of cardinals before that papal paragon, the sun.  Christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars, where on pink-fluted feet the pigeons pass and jonquils sprout like solomon's metaphors, my love and I go garlanded with grass.  Again we are deluded and infer that somehow we are younger than we were. \r\n                         \n", "Crystal Gazer": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Gerd sits spindle-shaped in her dark tent, Lean face gone tawn with seasons , Skin worn down to the knucklebones At her tough trade; without time's taint The burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens Fusing time's three horizons.  Two enter to tap her sight, a green pair Fresh leaved out in vows: 'Come tell How we shall do together, Well or ill.' Gerd slants a look at each: most dear, Each to the other; fit fiber for stern weather. Slowly she spins the ball:  'I see two stalwart apple trees Coupled by branches intertwined And, springing all about, Staunch saplings; to this house, thriving days Will bring crop's increase, and harvest fruit Follow on kind wind.'  'No hardship then?' he asks. 'We'll take Whatever trial's to come, so say true.' His bride echoes his word. At that, Gerd whirls the ball ablaze: 'Rough storm,' she grunts, ' may wreak Some havoc on tender limb, and yet Strengthen that orchard thereby.'  Their small price paid, these wedded ones Walk forth into sun-moneyed air, quickened To savor their span of flourishing. Aloof, squatting mummy-wise, Gerd scans That clairvoyant quartz which once, at her own wishing, Exacted her first simple sight for this strict second.  Then, a free-gadding hoyden, Gerd had craved To govern more sight than given to a woman By wits alone: to foresee her lover's faith And their future lot, she braved Church curse to ken that crooked oath Whereby one hires a demon.  A flash like doomcrack rent night's black: God's work stood anchored in that glare Focusing all time's day-suns in one So beggar Gerd might aim her look At gorgon-prospects with power to strike to stone Hearts of those who pierced time's core.  What Gerd saw then engraved her mind \u2014- Plague-pitted as the moon: each bud Shriveling to cinders at its source, Each love blazing blind to its gutted end \u2014- And, fixed in the crystal center, grinning fierce: Earth's ever-green death's head. \r\n                         \n", "The Lady And The Earthenware Head": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Fired in sanguine clay, the model head Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a dense lid, On the long bookshelf it stood Stolidly propping thick volumes of prose: spite-set Ape of her look. Best rid Hearthstone at once of the outrageous head; Still, she felt loath to junk it.  No place, it seemed, for the effigy to fare Free from all molesting. Rough boys, Spying a pate to spare Glowering sullen and pompous from an ash-heap, Might well seize this prize, Maltreat the hostage head in shocking wise, And waken the sly nerve up  That knits to each original its coarse copy. A dark tarn She thought of then, thick-silted, with weeds obscured, To serve her exacting turn: But out of the watery aspic, laureled by fins, The simulacrum leered, Lewdly beckoning, and her courage wavered: She blenched, as one who drowns,  And resolved more ceremoniously to lodge The mimic head\u2014in a crotched willow, green- Vaulted by foliage: Let bell-tongued birds descant in blackest feather On the rendering, grain by grain, Of that uncouth shape to simple sod again Through drear and dulcet weather.  Yet, shrined on her shelf, the grisly visage endured, Despite her wrung hands, her tears, her praying: Vanish! Steadfast and evil-starred, It ogled through rock-fault, wind-flaw and fisted wave\u2014 An antique hag-head, too tough for knife to finish, Refusing to diminish By one jot its basilisk-look of love. \r\n                         \n", "The Tour": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        O maiden aunt, you have come to call. Do step into the hall! With your bold Gecko, the little flick! All cogs, weird sparkle and every cog solid gold. And I in slippers and housedress with no lipstick!  And you want to be shown about! Yes, yes, this is my address. Not a patch on your place, I guess, with the Javanese Geese and the monkey trees. It's a bit burnt-out, A bit of a wild machine, a bit of a mess!  O I shouldn't put my finger in that Auntie, it might bite! That's my frost box, no cat, Though it looks like a cat, with its fluffy stuff, pure white. You should see the objects it makes! Millions of needly glass cakes!  Fine for the migraine or the bellyache. And this Is where I kept the furnace, Each coal a hot cross-stitch\u2014a lovely light! It simply exploded one night, It went up in smoke. And that's why I have no hair, auntie, that's why I choke  Off and on, as if I just had to retch. Coal gas is ghastly stuff. Here's a spot I thought you'd love\u2014 Morning Glory Pool! The blue's a jewel. It boils for forty hours at a stretch.  O I shouldn't dip my hankie in, it hurts! Last summer, my God, last summer It ate seven maids and a plumber And returned them steamed and pressed and stiff as shirts. I am bitter? I'm averse? Here's your specs, dear, here's your purse.  Toddle on home to tea now in your flat hat. It'll be lemon tea for me, Lemon tea and earwig biscuits\u2014creepy-creepy. You'd not want that. Toddle on home, before the weather's worse. Toddle on home, and don't trip on the nurse!\u2014  She may be bald, she may have no eyes, But auntie, she's awfully nice. She's pink, she's a born midwife\u2014 She can bring the dead to life With her wiggly fingers and for a very small fee. Well I hope you've enjoyed it, auntie!  Toddle on home to tea! \r\n                         \n"}
