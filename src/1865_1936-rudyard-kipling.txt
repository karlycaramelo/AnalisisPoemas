Zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed Their own high judgment on their lightest deed. Zeal was their spur that, when relief was given, Urged them unwearied to new toils in Heaven;  For Honour's sake perfecting every task Beyond what e 'en Perfection's self could ask. . . And Allah, Who created Zeal and Pride, Knows how the twain are perilous-near allied.   It chanced on one of Heaven's long-lighted days, The Four and all the Host being gone their ways Each to his Charge, the shining Courts were void Save for one Seraph whom no charge employed, With folden wings and slumber-threatened brow, To whom The Word: \"Beloved, what dost thou?\" \"By the Permission,\" came the answer soft, Little I do nor do that little oft. As is The Will in Heaven so on Earth Where by The Will I strive to make men mirth\" He ceased and sped, hearing The Word once more: \" Beloved, go thy way and greet the Four.\"  Systems and Universes overpast, The Seraph came upon the Four, at last, Guiding and guarding with devoted mind The tedious generations of mankind Who lent at most unwilling ear and eye When they could not escape the ministry. . . . Yet, patient, faithful, firm, persistent, just Toward all that gross, indifferent, facile dust, The Archangels laboured to discharge their trust By precept and example, prayer and law, Advice, reproof, and rule, but, labouring, saw Each in his fellows' countenance confessed, The Doubt that sickens: \"Have I done my best?\"  Even as they sighed and turned to toil anew, The Seraph hailed them with observance due; And, after some fit talk of higher things, Touched tentative on mundane happenings. This they permitting, he, emboldened thus, Prolused of humankind promiscuous, And, since the large contention less avails Than instances observed, he told them tales-- Tales of the shop, the bed, the court, the street, Intimate, elemental, indiscreet: Occasions where Confusion smiting swift Piles jest on jest as snow-slides pile the drift Whence, one by one, beneath derisive skies, The victims' bare, bewildered heads arise-- Tales of the passing of the spirit, graced With humour blinding as the doom it faced-- Stark tales of ribaldy that broke aside To tears, by laughter swallowed ere they dried- Tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue, But Only (Allah be exalted!) true, And only, as the Seraph showed that night, Delighting to the limits of delight.   These he rehearsed with artful pause and halt, And such pretence of memory at fault, That soon the Four--so well the bait was thrown-- Came to his aid with memories of their own-- Matters dismissed long since as small or vain, Whereof the high significance had lain Hid, till the ungirt glosses made it plain. Then, as enlightenment came broad and fast, Each marvelled at his own oblivious past Until--the Gates of Laughter opened wide-- The Four, with that bland Seraph at their side, While they recalled, compared, and amplified, In utter mirth forgot both Zeal and Pride!   High over Heaven the lamps of midnight burned Ere, weak with merriment, the Four returned, Not in that order they were wont to keep-- Pinion to pinion answering, sweep for sweep, In awful diapason heard afar-- But shoutingly adrift 'twixt star and star; Reeling a planet's orbit left or right As laughter took them in the abysmal Night; Or, by the point of some remembered jest, Winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed, Where the blank worlds that gather to the birth Leaped in the Womb of Darkness at their mirth, And e'en Gehenna's bondsmen understood. They were not damned from human brotherhood . . .  Not first nor last of Heaven's high Host, the Four That night took place beneath The Throne once more. 0 lovelier than their morning majesty, The understanding light behind the eye! 0 more compelling than their old command, The new-learned friendly gesture of the hand! 0 sweeter than their zealous fellowship, The wise half-smile that passed from lip to lip! 0 well and roundly, when Command was given, They told their tale against themselves to Heaven, And in the silence, waiting on The Word, Received the Peace and Pardon of The Lord! \r\n                         \n", "The Mare's Nest": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Jane Austen Beecher Stowe de Rouse Was good beyond all earthly need; But, on the other hand, her spouse Was very, very bad indeed.

She was so good, she made hime worse; (Some women are like this, I think;) He taught her parrot how to curse, Her Assam monkey how to drink. He vexed her righteous soul until She went up, and he went down hill.  Then came the crisis, strange to say, Which turned a good wife to a better. A telegraphic peon, one day, Brought her -- now, had it been a letter For Belial Machiavelli, I Know Jane would just have let it lie.  But 'twas a telegram instead, Marked \"urgent,\" and her duty plain To open it. Jane Austen read: \"Your Lilly's got a cough again. Can't understand why she is kept At your expense.\" Jane Austen wept.  It was a misdirected wire. Her husband was at Shaitanpore. She spread her anger, hot as fire, Through six thin foreign sheets or more. Sent off that letter, wrote another To her solicitor -- and mother.  Then Belial Machiavelli saw Her error and, I trust, his own, Wired to the minion of the Law, And traveled wifeward -- not alone. For Lilly -- thirteen-two and bay -- Came in a horse-box all the way.  There was a scene -- a weep or two -- With many kisses. Austen Jane Rode Lilly all the season through, And never opened wires again. She races now with Belial.

'There was no thought of Orb or Crown When the single wooden chest went down To the steering-flat, and the careless Gunroom haled him  To learn by ancient and bitter use, How neither Favour nor Excuse, Nor aught save his sheer self henceforth availed him.   'There was no talk of birth or rank By the slung hammock or scrubbed plank  In the steel-grated prisons where 1 cast him;  But niggard hours and a narrow space For rest-and the naked light on his face- While the ship's traffic flowed, unceasing, past him.   'Thus I schooled him to go and come- To speak at the word-at a sign be dumb;  To stand to his task, not seeking others to aid him;  To share in honour what praise might fall For the task accomplished, and-over all- To swallow rebuke in silence. Thus I made him.   'I loosened every mood of the deep On him, a child and sick for sleep, Through the long watches that no time can measure,  When I drove him, deafened and choked and blind,  At the wave-tops cut and spun by the wind;  Lashing him, face and eyes, with my displeasure.  'I opened him all the guile of the seas- Their sullen, swift-sprung treacheries,  To be fought, or forestalled, or dared, or dismissed with laughter. I showed him Worth by Folly concealed,  And the flaw in the soul that a chance revealed  (Lessons remembered-to bear fruit thereafter).  'I dealt him Power beneath his hand, For trial and proof, with his first Command- Himself alone, and no man to gainsay him.  On him the End, the Means, and the Word,  And the harsher judgment if he erred,  And-outboard-Ocean waiting to betray him.   'Wherefore, when he came to be crowned,  Strength in Duty held him bound, So that not Power misled nor ease ensnared him Who had spared himself no more than his seas had spared him!'  After His Lieges, in all His Lands, Had laid their hands between His hands, And His ships thundered service and devotion,  The Tide Wave, ranging the Planet, spoke  On all Our foreshores as it broke:- 'Know now what Man 1 gave you-I, the Ocean!' \r\n                         \n", "The Dead King": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        EDWARD VII.   Who in the Realm to-day lays down dear life for the sake of a land more dear? And, unconcerned for his own estate, toils till the last grudged sands have run? Let him approach. It is proven here Our King asks nothing of any man more than Our King himself, has done.  For to him above all was Life good, above all he commanded Her abundance full-handed. The peculiar treasure of Kings was his for the taking: All that men come to in dreams he inherited waking: --  His marvel of world-gathered armies -- one heart and all races; His seas 'neath his keels when his war-castles foamed to their places; The thundering foreshores that answered his heralded landing; The huge lighted cities adoring, the assemblies upstanding; The Councils of Kings called in haste to learn how he was minded -- The kingdoms, the Powers, and the Glories he dealt with unblinded.  To him came all captains of men, all achievers of glory Hot from the press of their battles they told him their story. They revealed him their lives in an hour and, saluting departed, Joyful to labour afresh -- he had made them new-hearted. And, since he weighed men from his youth, and no lie long deceived him, He spoke and exacted the truth, and the basest believed him.  And God poured him an exquisite wine, that was daily renewed to him, In the clear-welling love of his peoples that daily accrued to him. Honour and service we gave him, rejoicingly fearless; Faith absolute, trust beyond speech and a friendship as peerless. And since he was Master and Servant in all that we asked him, We leaned hard on his wisdom in all things, knowing not how we tasked him. For on him each new day laid command, every tyrannous hour, To confront, or confirm, or make smooth some dread issue of power; To deliver true, judgment aright at the instant, unaided, In the strict, level, ultimate phrase that allowed or dissuaded; To foresee, to allay, to avert from us perils unnumbered, To stand guard on our gates when he guessed that the watchmen had slumbered; To win time, to turn hate, to woo folly to service and, mightily schooling His strength to the use of his Nations, to rule as not ruling.  These were the works of our King; Earth's peace was the proof of them. God gave him great works to fulfil, and to us the behoof of them. We accepted his toil as our right -- none spared, none excused him. When he was bowed by his burden his rest was refused him. We troubled his age with our weakness -- the blacker our shame to us! Hearing his People had need of him, straightway he came to us.  As he received so he gave -- nothing grudged, naught denying, Not even the last gasp of his breath when he strove for us, dying. For our sakes, without question, he put from him all that he cherished. Simply as any that serve him he served and he perished. All that Kings covet was his, and he flung it aside for us. Simply as any that die in his service he died for us!  Who in the Realm to-day has choice of the easy road or the hard to tread? And, much concerned for his own estate, would sell his soul to remain in the sun? Let him depart nor look on Our dead. Our King asks nothing of any man more than Our King himself has done. \r\n                         \n", "The Conundrum Of The Workshops": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden's green and gold, Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould; And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart, Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves, \"It's pretty, but is it Art?\"   Wherefore he called to his wife, and fled to fashion his work anew -- The first of his race who cared a fig for the first, most dread review; And he left his lore to the use of his sons -- and that was a glorious gain When the Devil chuckled \"Is it Art?\" in the ear of the branded Cain.   They fought and they talked in the North and the South,   they talked and they fought in the West, Till the waters rose on the pitiful land, and the poor Red Clay had rest -- Had rest till that dank blank-canvas dawn when the dove was preened to start, And the Devil bubbled below the keel:  \"It's human, but is it Art?\"   They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart, Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks:  \"It's striking, but is it Art?\" The stone was dropped at the quarry-side and the idle derrick swung, While each man talked of the aims of Art, and each in an alien tongue.   The tale is as old as the Eden Tree -- and new as the new-cut tooth -- For each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows he is master of Art and Truth; And each man hears as the twilight nears, to the beat of his dying heart, The Devil drum on the darkened pane:  \"You did it, but was it Art?\"   We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplice-peg, We have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg, We know that the tail must wag the dog, for the horse is drawn by the cart; But the Devil whoops, as he whooped of old:  \"It's clever, but is it Art?\"   When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-room's green and gold, The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould -- They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves,   and the ink and the anguish start, For the Devil mutters behind the leaves:  \"It's pretty, but is it Art?\"   Now, if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow, And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago, And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through, By the favour of God we might know as much -- as our father Adam knew! \r\n                         \n", "The Song Of The Women": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        How shall she know the worship we would do her?

Before they win to the Pride o' Name,  I trow they all ask leave o' me.   \"For I make Honour wi' muckle mouth,  As I make Shame wi' mincin' feet, To sing wi' the priests at the market-cross,  Or run wi' the dogs in the naked street.   \"And some they give me the good red gold,  And some they give me the white money, And some they give me a clout o' meal,  For they be people o' low degree.   \"And the song I sing for the counted gold  The same I sing for the white money, But best I sing for the clout o' meal  That simple people given me.\"   The King cast down a silver groat,  A silver groat o' Scots money, \"If I come wi' a poor man's dole,\" he said,  \"True Thomas, will ye harp to me?\"   \"Whenas I harp to the children small,  They press me close on either hand. And who are you,\" True Thomas said,  \"That you should ride while they must stand?   \"Light down, light down from your horse o' pride,  I trow ye talk too loud and hie, And I will make you a triple word,  And syne, if ye dare, ye shall 'noble me.\"   He has lighted down from his horse o' pride,  And set his back against the stone. \"Now guard you well,\" True Thomas said,  \"Ere I rax your heart from your breast-bone!\"   True Thomas played upon his harp,  The fairy harp that couldna lee, And the first least word the proud King heard,  It harpit the salt tear out o' his ee.   \"Oh, I see the love that I lost long syne,  I touch the hope that I may not see, And all that I did o' hidden shame,  Like little snakes they hiss at me.   \"The sun is lost at noon -- at noon!  The dread o' doom has grippit me.

But I will bring you a better word  And lift the cloud that I laid on.\"   True Thomas played upon his harp,  That birled and brattled to his hand, And the next least word True Thomas made,  It garred the King take horse and brand.   \"Oh, I hear the tread o' the fighting men,  I see the sun on splent and spear. I mark the arrow outen the fern  That flies so low and sings so clear!   \"Advance my standards to that war,  And bid my good knights prick and ride; The gled shall watch as fierce a fight  As e'er was fought on the Border side!\"        'Twas bent beneath and blue above,       'Twas nodding grass and naked sky,      Where, ringing up the wastrel wind,       The eyas stooped upon the pie.   True Thomas sighed above his harp,  And turned the song on the midmost string; And the last least word True Thomas made,  He harpit his dead youth back to the King.   \"Now I am prince, and I do well  To love my love withouten fear; To walk wi' man in fellowship,  And breathe my horse behind the deer.   \"My hounds they bay unto the death,  The buck has couched beyond the burn, My love she waits at her window  To wash my hands when I return.   \"For that I live am I content  (Oh!

An' the more that you neeglect her the less you'll get her clean.

Then did robbers enter Britain from across the Northern main And our Lower River-field was won by Ogier the Dane.  Well could Ogier work his war-boat --well could Ogier wield his brand-- Much he knew of foaming waters--not so much of farming land. So he called to him a Hobden of the old unaltered blood, Saying: \"What about that River-piece; she doesn't look no good?\"  And that aged Hobden answered \"'Tain't for me not interfere. But I've known that bit o' meadow now for five and fifty year. Have it jest as you've a mind to, but I've proved it time on ' time, If you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime!\"  Ogier sent his wains to Lewes, twenty hours' solemn walk, And drew back great abundance of the cool, grey, healing chalk. And old Hobden spread it broadcast, never heeding what was in't.-- Which is why in cleaning ditches, now and then we find a flint.  Ogier died. His sons grew English -- Anglo-Saxon was their name-- Till out of blossomed Normandy another pirate came; For Duke William conquered England and divided with his men, And our Lower River-field he gave to William of Warenne.  But the Brook (you know her habit) rose one rainy autumn night  And tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right. So, said William to his Bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds: \"Hob, what about that River-bit--the Brook's got up no bounds? \"  And that aged Hobden answered: \"'Tain't my business to advise, But ye might ha' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies. Where ye can't hold back the water you must try and save the sile. Hev it jest as you've a mind to, but, if I was you, I'd spile!\"  They spiled along the water-course with trunks of willow-trees, And planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees.

Shall I dog his morning progress o'er the track-betraying dew? Demand his dinner-basket into which my pheasant flew? Confiscate his evening faggot under which my conies ran, And summons him to judgment? I would sooner summons Pan.  His dead are in the churchyard--thirty generations laid.

And there was little show of pride, Or prows of belted steel, For the clean-swept oceans every side Lay free to every keel.  And the first land he found, it was shoal and banky ground - Where the broader seas begin, And a pale tide grieving at the broken harbour-mouth Where they worked the death-ships in.  And there was neither gull on the wing, Nor wave that could not tell Of the bodies that were buckled in the life-buoy's ring That slid from swell to swell.  All that they had they gave - they gave; and they shall not return, For these are those that have no grave where any heart may mourn.

And there was neither blade of grass, Nor lone star in the sky But shook to see some spirit pass And took its agony.  And the next land be found, it was bare and hilly round - Where once the bread-corn grew, But the fields were cankered and the water was defiled, And the trees were riven through.  And there was neither paved highway, Nor secret path in the wood, But had borne its weight of the broken clay And darkened 'neath the blood.  Father and mother they put aside, and the nearer love also - An hundred thousand men who died whose graves shall no man know.  And the last land he found, it was fair and level ground About a carven stone, And a stark Sword brooding on the bosom of the Cross Where high and low are one.  And there was grass and the living trees, And the flowers of the spring, And there lay gentlemen from out of all the seas That ever called him King.  'Twixt Nieuport sands and the eastward lands where the Four Red Rivers spring, Five hundred thousand gentlemen of those that served their King.  All that they had they gave - they gave - In sure and single faith.

Stubborn all were his people from cottar to overlord-- Not to be cowed by the cudgel, scarce to be schooled by the sword; Quick to turn at their pleasure, cruel to cross in their mood, And set on paths of their choosing as the hogs of Andred's Wood. Laws they made in the Witan--the laws of flaying and fine-- Common, loppage and pannage, the theft and the track of kine-- Statutes of tun and of market for the fish and the malt and the  meal-- The tax on the Bramber packhorse and the tax on the Hastings keel. Over the graves of the Druids and under the wreck of Rome, Rudely but surely they bedded the plinth of the days to come. Behind the feet of the Legions and before the Norseman's ire Rudely but greatly begat they the framing of State and Shire. Rudely but deeply they laboured, and their labour stands till now, If we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eight--ox plough... There came a king from Hamlun, by Bosenham he came, He filled Use with slaughter, and Lewes he gave to flame. He smote while they sat in the Witan--sudden he smote and sore, That his fleet was gathered at Selsea ere they mustered at Cymen's Ore. Blithe went the Saxons to battle, by down and wood and mere, But thrice the acorns ripened ere the western mark was clear. Thrice was the beechmast gathered, and the Beltane fires burned Thrice and, the beeves were salted thrice ere the host returned. They drove that king from Hamtun, by Bosenhame o'erthrown, Our of Rugnor to Wilton they made his land their own. Camps they builded at Gilling, at Basing and Alresford, But wrath abode in the Saxons from cottar to overlord. Wrath at the weary war-game, at the foe that snapped and ran, Wolf-wise feigning and flying, and wolf-wise snatching his man. Wrath for their spears unready, their levies new to the blade-- Shame for the helpless sieges and the scornful ambuscade. At hearth and tavern and market, wherever the tale was told, Shame and wrath had the Saxons because of their boasts of old. And some would drink and deny it, and some would pray and atone; But the most part, after their anger, avouched that the sin was their own. Wherefore, girding together, up to the Witan they came, And as they had shouldered their bucklers so did they shoulder their blame; (For that was the wont of the Saxons, the ancient poets sing), And first they spoke in the Witan and then they spoke to the King: \"Edward King of the Saxons, thou knowest from sire to son, \"One is the King and his People--in gain and ungain one. \"Count we the gain together. With doubtings and spread dismays \"We have broken a foolish people--but after many days. \"Count we the loss together. Warlocks hampered our arms. \"We were tricked as by magic, we were turned as by charms. \"We went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep, \"But our angry eyes ever holden, and we struck as they strike in sleep-- \"Men new shaken from slumber, sweating with eyes a-stare \"Little blows uncertain, dealt on the useless air. \"Also a vision betrayed us and a lying tale made bold, \"That we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we did not hold: That a shield should give us shelter--that a sword should give us power-- A shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an hour: \"That being rich in the open, we should be strong in the close-- \"And the Gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met our foes. \"This was the work of wizards, but not with our foe they bide, \"In our own camp we took them, and their names are Sloth and Pride. \"Our pride was before the battle, our sloth ere we lifted spear: \"But hid in the heart of the people, as the fever hides in the mere: \"Waiting only the war-game, the heat of the strife to rise \"As the ague fumes round Oxeney when the rotting reed-bed dries. \"But now we are purged of that fever--cleansed by the letting  of blood, \"Something leaner of body--something keener of mood. \"And the men new--freed from the levies return to the fields again, \"Matching a hundred battles, cottar and lord and thane; \"And they talk loud in the temples where the ancient war- gods are; \"They thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war. \"They jest at the sacred chariots, the robes and the gilded staff. \"These things fill them with laughter, they lean on their spears and laugh. \"The men grown old in the war-game, hither and thither they range-- \"And scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change; \"And change may be good or evil--but we know not what it will  bring; \"Therefore our King must teach us.

'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,   Where sailor-men reside, And there were men of all the ports   From Mississip to Clyde, And regally they spat and smoked,   And fearsomely they lied.  They lied about the purple Sea   That gave them scanty bread, They lied about the Earth beneath,   The Heavens overhead, For they had looked too often on   Black rum when that was red.  They told their tales of wreck and wrong,   Of shame and lust and fraud, They backed their toughest statements with   The Brimstone of the Lord, And crackling oaths went to and fro   Across the fist-banged board.  And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,   Bull-throated, bare of arm, Who carried on his hairy chest   The maid Ultruda's charm -- The little silver crucifix   That keeps a man from harm.  And there was Jake Withouth-the-Ears,   And Pamba the Malay, And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,   And Luz from Vigo Bay, And Honest Jack who sold them slops   And harvested their pay.

Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks,   Collinga knew her fame, From Tarnau in Galicia   To Juan Bazaar she came, To eat the bread of infamy   And take the wage of shame.  She held a dozen men to heel --   Rich spoil of war was hers, In hose and gown and ring and chain,   From twenty mariners, And, by Port Law, that week, men called   her Salem Hardieker's.  But seamen learnt -- what landsmen know --   That neither gifts nor gain Can hold a winking Light o' Love   Or Fancy's flight restrain, When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes   On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.  Since Life is strife, and strife means knife,   From Howrah to the Bay, And he may die before the dawn   Who liquored out the day, In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house   We woo while yet we may.  But cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,   Bull-throated, bare of arm, And laughter shook the chest beneath   The maid Ultruda's charm -- The little silver crucifix   That keeps a man from harm.  \"You speak to Salem Hardieker;   \"You was his girl, I know. \"I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,   \"Und round the Skaw we go, \"South, down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,   \"To Besser in Saro.\"  When love rejected turns to hate,   All ill betide the man. \"You speak to Salem Hardieker\" --   She spoke as woman can. A scream -- a sob -- \"He called me -- names!\"   And then the fray began.  An oath from Salem Hardieker,   A shriek upon the stairs, A dance of shadows on the wall,   A knife-thrust unawares -- And Hans came down, as cattle drop,   Across the broken chairs.  .       .       .       .       .       .

Thus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,   Bull-throated, bare of arm, But Anne of Austria looted first   The maid Ultruda's charm -- The little silver crucifix   That keeps a man from harm. \r\n                         \n", "The Landau": "itemprop=\"text\">\r\n                        Praed   There was a landau deep and wide, Cushioned for Sleep's own self to sit on-- The glory of the country-side From Tanner's End to Marlow Ditton.

Ahmed Shah was a man of peace -  His beard and turban were thick with grease:  His paunch was huge and his speech was slow  And he swindled the subalterns high and low,  Scores of subalterns came to try The tats that he sold - and remained to buy,  Scores of subalterns later on  Found that their flashiest mounts were 'gone' -  Some in the front and some behind  Some were roarers and some went blind -  Scores of subalterns over their 'weeds'  Cursed old Ahmed and all his deeds.  But Ahmed Shah in his gully sat still -  And ever he fashioned a Little Black Pill!   Yet a judgement was brewing for Ahmed Shah,  Like a witches cauldron, in far Morar  And the youth that brewed it has eyes of blue  And his cheek was beardless and boundless too.  Softly he mused o'er a trichi thick:- 'By the Beard of the Prophet I've got the trick!'  Then he rose from his chair with an artless grin  And called the Battery Sergeant in:- 'Sergeant' he said 'Hasst aught for me In the way of a 'caster' with lots of gee ?'  The sergeant pondered and answered slow  'There's a red-roan gelding that's bound to go At the next Committee. 'E ain't no use  Excep' for kickin' recruits to the deuce,  'E's chained in the sick lines.'  The subaltern's brow  Was puckered with thought for a moment. Then  The sergeant was richer by rupees ten.  'When the next Committee sits' quoth he 'O Sergeant buy up that brute for me.'   So the plot was laid and the long weeks passed  And the red-road gelding was duly cast.  They led him in chains to the subaltern's stall  And gave him his gram' through a hole in the wall.  The subaltern mixed it. When morning came  The red-road gelding was strangely tame.  He bit not nor kicked nor essayed to slay  And he and the sub went north that day  Till they came to the gully of Ahmed Shah The man and the horse from far Morar.  The subaltern stated his funds were low And he came - mehrbani - to 'sell karo'.  Then Ahmed Shah with his eyes agog  Broke the Tenth Command in the decalogue,  For the roan was a monster in size and thews And stood over sixteen hand in his shoes.  'Sahib kitna mangta?' With brow serene  The subaltern softly answered 'Teen'.  He haggled an hour, that dealer thrifty  Till the price was lowered to do sow fifty  And the money was paid in greasy rupees While the red-roan gelding drowsed at his ease.  The subaltern left him - and Ahmed smiled -  'By Allah, how mad is this pink-faced child I will stuff that ghorah with attah and goor  And sell him again to some English soor For a clear eight-fifty!'\u2026 and e'en as he spoke  The devil they'd drugged in the red-roan woke !  Then the head-ropes snapped and the heel-ropes drew And the stallions squealed as the roan went through  And the syces ran as men run for life  And the yard was troubled with equine strife  Till the berserk-rage of the beat was o'er  And he dropped to slumber at Ahmed's door!   Then a veil was lifted from Ahmed's eyes  And he raised the eyelids and punched the thighs  Felt the tense pulse slacken - the muscles still -  And fathomed the Trcik of the Opium Pill!  His own old dodge that had brought him pelf  Had the subaltern turned against himself!  Did he swear, though his three best tats were lame  And half of the city would hear of his shame ?  Did he seek the law courts? With downcast eye  He hailed an ekka that jingled by,  And drove to the station, where filled with peace  The subaltern counted the greasy rupees.   What passed between them? I cannot say,  The subaltern turns the question away  With an innocent laugh: but the men of Morar  Say he still gets ponies from Ahmed Shah.  Ponies to bet on - but not to buy -  Weeds to look at but devils to fly  And once in a while comes a tiny pill-box.

His wives, disregarding the orders of the English against Suttee,      would have broken out of the palace had not the gates been barred.      But one of them, disguised as the King's favourite dancing-girl,      passed through the line of guards and reached the pyre.  There,      her courage failing, she prayed her cousin, a baron of the court,      to kill her.  This he did, not knowing who she was.       Udai Chand lay sick to death     In his hold by Gungra hill.

All night the barons came and went,     The lords of the outer guard: All night the cressets glimmered pale On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail, Mewar headstall and Marwar mail,     That clinked in the palace yard.   In the Golden room on the palace roof     All night he fought for air: And there was sobbing behind the screen, Rustle and whisper of women unseen, And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen     On the death she might not share.   He passed at dawn -  the death-fire leaped     From ridge to river-head, From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars: And wail upon wail went up to the stars Behind the grim zenana-bars,     When they knew that the King was dead.   The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth     And robe him for the pyre. The Boondi Queen beneath us cried: 'See, now, that we die as our mothers died In the bridal-bed by our master's side!      Out, women! -  to the fire! '   We drove the great gates home apace:     White hands were on the sill: But ere the rush of the unseen feet Had reached the turn to the open street, The bars shot down, the guard-drum beat -      We held the dovecot still.   A face looked down in the gathering day,     And laughing spoke from the wall: 'Oh]/e, they mourn here:  let me by -  Azizun, the  Lucknow nautch-girl, I!  When the house is rotten, the rats must fly,     And I seek another thrall.   'For I ruled the King as ne'er did Queen, -      To-night the Queens rule me!  Guard them safely, but let me go, Or ever they pay the debt they owe In scourge and torture! '  She leaped below,     And the grim guard watched her flee.   They knew that the King had spent his soul     On a North-bred dancing-girl: That he prayed to a flat-nosed Lucknow god, And kissed the ground where her feet had trod, And doomed to death at her drunken nod,     And swore by her lightest curl.   We bore the King to his fathers' place,     Where the tombs of the Sun-born stand: Where the gray apes swing, and the peacocks preen On fretted pillar and jewelled screen, And the wild boar couch in the house of the Queen     On the drift of the desert sand.

Small thought had he to mark the strife -      Cold fear with hot desire -  When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame, And thrice she beat her breast for shame, And thrice like a wounded dove she came     And moaned about the fire.   One watched, a bow-shot from the blaze,     The silent streets between, Who had stood by the King in sport and fray, To blade in ambush or boar at bay, And he was a baron old and gray,     And kin to the Boondi Queen.
